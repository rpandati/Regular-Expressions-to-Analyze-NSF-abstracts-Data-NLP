      "a9000006 DEB $179720 Commercial exploitation over the past two hundred years drove the great Mysticete whales to near extinction. Variation in the sizes of populations prior to exploitation, minimal population size during exploitation and current population sizes permit analyses of the effects of differing levels of exploitation on species with different biogeographical distributions and life-history characteristics. Dr. Stephen Palumbi at the University of Hawaii will study the genetic population structure of three whale species in this context, the Humpback Whale, the Gray Whale and the Bowhead Whale. The effect of demographic history will be determined by comparing the genetic structure of the three species. Additional studies will be carried out on the Humpback Whale. The humpback has a world-wide distribution, but the Atlantic and Pacific populations of the northern hemisphere appear to be discrete populations, as is the population of the southern hemispheric oceans. Each of these oceanic populations may be further subdivided into smaller isolates, each with its own migratory pattern and somewhat distinct gene pool. This study will provide information on the level of genetic isolation among populations and the levels of gene flow and genealogical relationships among populations. This detailed genetic information will facilitate international policy decisions regarding the conservation and management of these magnificent mammals.\n",
      "a9000031 MCB $300000 Studies of chickens have provided serological and nucleic acid probes useful in defining the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in other avian species. Methods used in detecting genetic diversity at loci within the MHC of chickens and mammals will be applied to determining the extent of MHC polymorphism within small populations of ring-necked pheasants, wild turkeys, cranes, Andean condors and other species. The knowledge and expertise gained from working with the MHC of the chicken should make for rapid progress in defining the polymorphism of the MHC in these species and in detecting the polymorphism of MHC gene pool within small wild and captive populations of these birds. Genes within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) are known to encode molecules that provide the context for recognition of foreign antigens by the immune system. Whether a given animal is able to mount an immune response to the challenge of a pathogen is determined, in part, by the allelic makeup of its MHC. In many species, an unusually high degree of polymorphism is maintained at multiple loci within the MHC in freely breeding populations. The allelic pool within a population presumably provides diversity upon which to draw in the face of environmental challenge. The objective of the proposed research is to extend ongoing studies of the MHC of domesticated fowl to include avian species experiencing severe reduction in population size. Knowledge of the MHC gene pool within populations and of the haplotypes of individual animals may be useful in the husbandry of species requiring intervention for their preservation.\n",

This understanding is essential for modelling and designing studies of marine productivity and food web dynamics. Specifically, they will: * Study the diatom life cycle, to better understand what environmental and genetic factors control the switch from vegetative to sexual reproduction; * Investigate the cell cycle in cyanobacteria and marine bacteria, to better understand how their DNA cycle is regulated under changing growth conditions, and why aspects of the cycle deviate from the classic E. coli model; * Develop a multichannel, high-sensitivity (and relatively inexpensive) flow cytometer, which will facilitate the study small picoplankton and marine bacteria. The results of this work will augment our understanding of microbial growth rates in the sea and phytoplankton population genetics; it should also contribute methodological advances for the study of marine bacteria at sea. Moreover, it could enhance our fundamental understanding of microbial physiology by revealing features of marine organisms which deviate from classical paradigms.\n",

This connection will be investigated, using the notion of \"immunity\" as a tool. Width-bounded reducibility: This notion will be used as a tool to investigate the relationships among \"similar\" complexity classes.

      "a9000053 DMS $197491 The mathematical theories of multivariate polynomial interpolation and multivariate spline approximation differ in content and goals, yet share a common source. In addition, many of the mathematical tools used to analyze basic questions are similar. Underlying much of this work has been the problem of developing a strategy for developing a theory of splines in several dimensions which is both computationally effective and as accurate as the one dimensional basis from which the subject arose. Work on multivariate polynomial interpolation derives from problems in what became known as box spline theory. A surprisingly simple and general method for choosing, for any given finite set of points in a space of several variables, a good polynomial space for interpolation at those points, has been discovered. Work will now be done exploring the theoretical and practical ramifications of this discovery. A long-term objective is to construct a coherent theory of interpolation, one which will play a more important role in multivariate numerical analysis. There are many approaches to spline approximation in higher dimensions currently in use. Each is associated with a certain type of mesh along which the elements are joined. The focus of this work will be that of approximation order. A better understanding of what makes for a good approximation order is expected to lead to the construction of better approximation methods. Ultimately, one would like to develop a unification of the various theories and techniques now extant. A particularly important area of application of this work is in providing mathematical models of surfaces, often from a given set of bounding curves. The mainstay of industrial work at this time is a method which only works for relatively flat surfaces. One immediate goal is to obtain a better understanding of how one can tell whether a given surface can be well represented by a small number of patches.\n",
      "a9000054 DMS $12192 Work to be done during the period of this award will focus on higher dimensional inverse scattering problems and on related one dimensional problems. The underlying idea for work of this nature is that of constructing obstacles from data measured as particles pass the obstacle. The transition from the future of a solution of, say, the wave equation, to the past is called the scattering transform. Knowledge of either the transform or its spectrum is considered to be central to understanding any wave or generalized wave which experiences scattering. This work will consider extending results on time dependent Schrodinger equations with slowly decaying potentials in which the inverse equation admits simple poles. In higher dimensional settings the advent of multiple poles cannot be ruled out. However, their structure is not understood. The question of whether or not they may accumulate will also be studied. One method to be used will consider solutions for time dependent Schrodinger equations which are not necessarily bounded in time. This method has been used to achieve the complete solution (for all potentials) for the one dimensional nxn inverse scattering problem as well as for the one dimensional n-th order scalar equation. Several classical equations and systems are expected to be analyzed using results developed through this investigation. They include the Zakharov-Shabat system and the KPI equation.\n",
      "a9000057 INT $20348 This proposal requests funds to permit Dr. Patrick S. Mariano, Department of Chemistry, University of Maryland, to pursue with Dr. Ung Chan Yoon, Department of Chemistry, Pusan National University, for a period of 24 months, a program of cooperative research on electron transfer-induced photochemical reactions of organic systems. Specifically, sequential electron transfer-electrofugal group elimination sequences, promoted by excitation of reacting substrates or electron transfer photosensitizers, will be employed as general methods for generation of heteroatom substituted carbon radicals. The mechanistic details and synthetic applications of these processes will be probed. This project is a continuation of the cooperative research of the two investigators supported under NSF Grant No. INT-8717920, and adds an international cooperative dimension to Dr. Mariano's current research under NSF Grant No. CHE-8917725. Their previous collaborative research has been highly successful and has resulted in several joint publications in refereed journals. This successful collaboration has generated ideas which serve as the basis for continuing joint research. The studies planned for the period of continued collaboration should provide knowledge about various aspects of the new area of electron transfer photochemistry (photoelectrochemistry) and about new and potentially efficient methods for construction of complex molecular structures.

      "a9000063 DEB $320700 The effects of deforestation on the extinction rates of plant species in tropical rain forests are well documented. Less is known about the impact of deforestation on the loss of genetic variation within tree species because there is not enough information about the amount and patterns of spatial distribution of genetic variation in natural populations. Genetic variation is considered to be important in the long term survival of populations. Thus, information about the amount and patterns of genetic variation within and among populations is central to the design of appropriate measures to conserve tropical tree populations. Equally important is to understand the genetic factors, such as mating systems and the level of gene exchange among populations, which greatly influence the distribution of genetic variation. Many tree species in tropical rain forests have low population density. Small populations may lose genetic variation, and may also be subject to inbreeding depression (deleterious effects in reproductive output due to mating among close relatives). Thus, it is paricularly important to study factors regulating genetic variation in species that typically occur in low densities. The objectives of this research are to 1. analyze the amount and patterns of genetic variation, 2. estimate effective population size, 3. measure the rate of outcrossing (or inbreeding), 4. determine the level of gene exchange among populations, and 5. examine the effects of density on the level of inbreeding and reproductive output in natural populations of tropical lowland rain forest trees. The field work will be conducted at the La Selva Biological Field Station of the Organization for Tropical Studies in Costa Rica, and the laboratory work at the University of Massachusetts at Boston.\n",
      "a9000075 IBN $159944 In collaboration with Costa Rican graduate students and scientists at two universities in Costa Rica, Dr. Owens will carry out a two-year field study of the behavioral factors influencing the migrations and unique nesting patterns of the olive ridley sea turtle. The olive ridley and the closely related Kemp's ridley have a distinctive nesting behavior in which thousands of turtles gather in nearshore waters at the nesting beach and then emerge en masse to lay their eggs. This mass nesting is commonly known by the Spanish word \"arribada,\" but the physiological mechanisms and environmental cues involved are unknown. The olive ridley is a commercially important species threatened with extinction because it is under extreme exploitation pressure from fisheries between Mexico and Equador. Because of the lack of data on the at-sea behavior and movements of the olive ridley, any information collected will contribute significantly to our understanding of this animal. The objectives of this study are to (1) monitor the pre-nesting and post-nesting at-sea movements and diving characteristics of the olive ridley and (2) determine the behavioral components involved in arribada mating and massing. These data will then be combined with information on the physiology of the same turtles, being obtained under grant BNS 88-19940. Dr. Owens and his colleagues will attach satellite-tracking transmitters to female and male olive ridleys to follow their movements. Both behavior in the vicinity of the nesting beach and long-term migrations away from the nesting beach to the feeding grounds will be studied. Monitoring these movements will allow the researchers to evaluate feeding, courtship, mating, and massing behaviors prior to and following arribada events. An improved understanding of the factors regulating the mass nesting and migratory behaviors has basic importance in marine zoology and potential value in developing improved methods for conserving this commercially exploited species.\n",
      "a9000089 DEB $477000 Our ability to restore tropical ecosystems and to construct sustainable, useful analogs of tropical forests depends on our ability to grow communities of plants that are ecologically compatible. This research will evaluate mixtures of species likely to use space and soil resources in complementary ways, enabling them to take good advantage of the high potential productivity of the humid tropics while protecting the soil. Plants of three life forms (those that are self.supporting and have broad, horizontally displayed leaves; those that are self . J H.supporting, with narrow, erect or arching leaves; and vines) and three life spans (several months to many decades) will be grown in combinations of one, two, or three species at the La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica. The performance of the gardens will be evaluated by measuring growth, light capture, water use, and nutrient retention. The efficiency with which simple and complex communities use resources is likely to improve dramatically during the first two years of growth, and longer.lived plants are likely to excel as community age increases. Because invasions by unwanted species are so important to the maintenance of native biodiversity, each artificial community will be tested for resistance to invasion by native and exotic plants.\n",
      "a9000091 DEB $169000 Optimizing the chances of survival of rare or endangered plants is a fundamental concern of plant conservation biologists. Part of this effort involves assessing the current \"health\" of populations and predicting chances of their long-term survival. This work will compare two methods of assessing population \"health\" and the likelihood of long-term survival for the royal catch-fly (Silene regia), a prairie relict. The investigators will determine levels of genetic variation in populations of various size, isolation, and management using biochemical techniques. It is generally held that populations high in genetic variation are better buffered against environmental perturbations in the short-term and that genetic variation provides a pool of resources that can be drawn from for long-term adaption and evolutionary change. However, the importance of genetic variation to the persistence of plant populations has rarely been demonstrated with field studies. The investigators will compare data from genetic studies with demographic data of actual survival, seed production, and seedling establishment of plants in the same sites. Computer modeling will be used to project, based on actual values recorded over the relatively short term of the study, into the future to estimate which populations are most likely to persist.\n",
      "a9000094 IBN $53563 The continued destruction of the coastal and tropical forest in South and Central America threatens the survival of natural animal populations, including the callitrichid primates (tamarins and marmosets). While the golden lion tamarins are considered an endangered species, through a highly successful breeding program at the University of Nebraska under the auspices of the National Zoological Park, these primates are being bred in captivity and a small group of six have recently been reintroduced into forests of Brazil. Their survival as a species, however, depends extensively on understanding how their reproduction is synchronized to lead to a greater likelihood of fertilization. Dr. French will investigate the complex interplay between internal physiological factors and external social and environmental factors in gold lion tamarins. Unlike Old World primates and apes, the callitrichid primates are monogamous and thus, develop a close and long-lasting association, or pair- bond, between a breeding male and female. Dr. French will use noninvasive data collection techniques for both hormone samples and behavioral measurements to compare the degree to which social factors influence hormonal regulation of reproduction. His findings will be compared with the results obtained in similarly conducted studies in which Old World non-monogamous primate species have been used. This work will contribute to our understanding of the role of hormonal and social influences on reproductive behavior in golden lion tamarins as well as other New World primates of which many are considered threatened or endangered species. Furthermore, the results will significantly enhance the captive breeding programs of endangered species and thus, contribute to the preservation of these small South American primates.\n",
      "a9000099 BCS $199979 9000099 Blumenschine With National science Foundation support, Dr. Robert Blumenschine and his colleagues will conduct two seasons of archaeological research at Olduvai Gorge in northern Tanzania. They will focus on two stratigraphic horizons which date to just under 2 million years ago and which preserve traces of human activity. Dr. Blumenschine and colleagues will sample these horizons through carefully controlled excavation and will collect both stone artifacts and faunal remains. Because each horizon extends over a considerable horizontal distance, through comparison of samples, the team will be able to reconstruct a broad range of hominid (and likely non-hominid) activities, gain insight into geographically varied behavior, and place this in an environmental framework. This research is significant for two primary reasons. First it will shed new light on the emergence of human cultural capabilities. Olduvai Gorge has yielded not only important hominid fossil remains, but also numerous assemblages of stone tools and apparently associated fauna. These materials have provided a focus for examination of the cultural capacities of early hominids. Using data from the Olduvai sites paleoanthropologists have speculated on issues such as the role of meat in early hominid diet and questioned whether such peoples had the ability to hunt. Most of the available data comes from \"sites\" or dense, spacially clustered groups of stone and bone remains. Archaeologists however have come to realize that such clusters represent only one aspect of hominid behavior and that smaller less dense scatters and areas which have no material at all can also provide important relevant information. Dr. Blumenschine and colleagues will focus their attention in a systematic fashion on both the \"clusters\" and the scatter between the sites. Secondly, this work will help to pioneer the field of \"landscape archaeology.\" The team will develop techniques for the collection and analysis of non-s ite data and these methods will be applicable in a wide variety of archaeological situations. This work will provide insight into early hominid behavior. It will yield data of interest to many archaeologists and assist in the training of Tanzanian researchers. It will serve to strengthen the scientific ties between African and United States scientists. ***\n",
      "a9000100 IBN $49219 All 37 species of monitor lizards are considered as threatened or endangered. Habitat destruction and human intervention have caused serious disturbances in numerous populations of these lizards (genus Varanus). Complicating this decrease in diversity is that monitor lizards do not reproduce well in captivity. Indeed successful captive propagation of selected species has only occurred after sufficient behavioral and physiological information has been collected from natural populations. With permission from the Department of Nature Conservation in Namibia, Africa, Dr. Phillips will study savanna monitor lizards in their natural habitat. Integrating a series of field and laboratory studies, he and his colleague, Dr. Pratt, will determine the hormonal correlates of behavior in males and females, examine the environmental and social conditions required for successful hatching of eggs, and determine what causes reproductive dysfunction in captive female monitor lizards. Not only will these findings provide baseline data from which the other varanid species can be compared, but the establishment of ecophysiological data base that emphasizes the behavioral and endocrinological aspects of natural reproduction could proved a proximate solution for maintaining viable populations. Indeed information originating from this work is essential to establish successful captive breeding programs which will allow for the preservation of the species and the eventual reintroduction of these monitor lizards into the wild.\n",
      "a9000102 DEB $140070 Traditional forestry practices in the Northeast have led to the dispersion of forest openings and scattered clear cuts throughout large regions. The result is a fine-scaled mosaic of young and older forests. Such fragmentation has also created large amounts of \"edge\" habitat, purposefully constructed to boost populations of White-tailed Deer and other game species. These efforts have succeeded in boosting deer populations far beyond presettlement densities to the point where browsing by deer now appears to threaten plant species diversity by preventing the recruitment and regeneration of certain gymnosperms and associated herbaceous species. We propose to use existing long-term deer and plant survey data and the presence of areas of reduced deer density to test hypotheses concerning the impacts of deer browsing on species diversity and community composition and dynamics. We will also compare the size and age structure and community composition of forest stands dominated by Eastern Hemlock and White Cedar among areas that vary in deer density. Finally, we will use experiments to test the direct and indirect effects of deer browsing. Results from this study are needed to document this new type of edge effect and to design practical patterns of forest use compatible with maintaining the original species and community diversity of northern forests. Such analyses will allow implementation of appropriate conservation strategies.\n",
      "a9000110 DMS $71000 Work to be done on this project continues mathematical research on nonlinear elliptic problems arising in perfect-fluid hydrodynamics. Emphasis will be placed on the analytical study of the propagation of waves in stratified media. Techniques from nonlinear analysis and partial differential equations form the basis for these studies. The primary goals are to understand better the nature of internal waves and the presence of vortex rings. The internal waves arise from density stratification due to changes in salinity or temperature, for example. Experimental work shows striking examples of internal wave phenomena, and oceanic observations reveal internal waves up to 100 meters in amplitude. This work will concentrate on the analysis of waves in the two-fluid system where two fluids of constant density meet along a smooth density profile. In this case, center-manifold theory can be applied to study the ordinary differential equations which replace the nonlinear partial differential equations for the wave motion. Recent applications of global analysis to study vortex rings which have a Heaviside function distribution have proved effective. Work will continue in an effort to understand the properties of the level set of the solutions to the equation describing the vortex displacement function. The equation has jump discontinuities, for which existence can sometimes be established, but the nature of the level sets remains a mystery.\n",

Auroral emissions will be calculated from the excitation rates using a time-dependent chemical model and the most recent climatological and prognostic models of the thermosphere and ionosphere. These models will be used to examine some of the pressing and controversial problems in auroral emission production and for interpretation in a number of CEDAR (Coupling,Energetics and Dynamics of Atmospheric Regions) campaigns.***\n",
      "a9000112 OCE $228603 The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will continue an oceanographic instrumentation development project to develop, construct, and test a multi-channel, in situ flow injection chemical analysis system. The objective of the device is to make autonomous in-situ colorometric measurements of nitrate and phosphate to full ocean depths for periods of up to six months. Simultaneous measurement of additional inorganic nutrients is planned for he future. A shallow water prototype has been constructed, but is depth limited because it relies on an umbilical cable to provide power and to control the various pumps and motors. This new effort will develop the electronics and mechanisms to enable the analyzer to function autonomously in depths of down to 6,000 meters. Anti-fouling measures will be developed and reagent stability tests will be made to allow long-term unattended deployments. The analyzer is ideally suited for testing a new scientific hypothesis about primary productivity in oligotrophic waters being driven by sporadic and short-lived injections of nutrients. The analyzer is also intended to have numerous applications in time-series investigations relating to GOFS Global Geoscience initiative.\n",
      "a9000117 CTS $252238 Nonsteady state performance of chemical reactors are difficult to predict and analyze. Many industrial reactors exhibit such behavior and the result is that the large and unexpected swings in performance mandate their operation far from productivity maxima. This also has the potential to cause serious accidents. By understanding the mechanisms and manifestations of reactor dynamics, existing processes can be improved, reactor safety can be increased, and new modes of reactor operation may become feasible. The PIs plan to focus on the dynamic behavior of a class of nonlinear systems: catalytic reactors. They are planning a program designed to characterize catalytic reactions and reactors experimentally and theoretically in order to develop a more fundamental understanding of these systems and an improved ability to control them. Experiments will probe the dynamics of oscillatory and multiple steady states by monitoring spatial and temporal variations of spontaneous catalytic oscillators and of systems perturbed between states. Systems studied will primarily be fast reactions on noble metals where heat effects and nonlinear kinetics combine to produce these behaviors. In particular, the selectivities of endothermic decomposition reactions and exothermic oxidation reactions on Pt and Rh surfaces in single crystal, wire, foil, monolith, and supported forms will be studied. Models will be developed to simulate spatial and temporal dynamics in these systems, to determine the types of behavior which may occur, and to develop more efficient algorithms to solve nonlinear reactor problems. Effects of strong attractive adsorbate interactions, multiple surface phases, and surface diffusion limitations on reaction systems will be modelled. New computational methods such as inertial manifold theory will also be applied to these problem. ***//\n",

They have a variety of current applications in scientific and analytical instruments, and are likely to be useful in X-ray microlithography systems to make increasingly miniaturized semiconductor devices. A prototype reactor has been constructed to begin production of multilayers by atomic layer epitaxy (ALE). Some calculations have been done which indicate that smoother, thinner layers yielding higher reflectivity at shorter X-ray wavelengths are possible.\n",

Enhancements will be added to a primitive equation model and a filtered model (both developed by the P.I. and collaborators). Major focus will be on : 1. Domain decomposition strategies and boundary-fitted coordinates to add boundary layers with higher order physics; 2. Conservation properties of efficient finite difference schemes; 3. Composite overlapping grid techniques for embedding the mixed layer in the larger models; and 4. Comparison of the PE model with tropical Atlantic data.\n",

Let C be a class of abelian groups such as the class of all totally projective abelian p-groups and let A,B be abelian groups in C. The principal investigator will describe Tor(A,B); determine if Tor(A,B) is in C; and characterize C using the torsion product. This project is in the general area of abelian group theory. Finite abelian groups have been completely classified but the classification of infinite abelian groups remains elusive. This research will contribute to the knowlege of infinite abelian groups by studying the interplay between set theory and abelian groups.\n",
      "a9000130 OCE $465457 The University of Michigan will operate the R/V LAURENTIAN during 1990 as a general oceanographic vessel in support of NSF-funded research projects. The LAURENTIAN is a 80' general research vessel constructed in 1974. It is owned by the University of Michigan. This vessel is part of a fleet used by the National Science Foundation to support oceanographic research projects. Most oceanographic research projects require highly specialized equipment and extensive support from a ship's crew members. An increasing number of research projects require equipment that must be permanently installed on a ship and for which the ship must be specifically designed. Such equipment also requires highly trained crew members for maintenance and operation. These vessels do not operate in the same manner as general cargo or fishing vessels, and therefore, NSF supports the operation of a variety of vessels specifically dedicated to oceanographic research. These vessels are operated by universities and research institutions around the country. The R/V LAURENTIAN is a capable vessel for the work proposed. The program considers the ship an important part of the fleet due to its location. The LAURENTIAN is the only NSF-funded vessel that operates in the Great Lakes, and the University of Michigan should be encouraged to improve usage of the vessel.\n",

He will consider uniform and universal classes of functions for different limit theorems, the parametric and the non-parametric bootstrap, U-processes and differentiable functionals with the general aim of increasing the applicability of modern empirical process theory. He will also continue to study the characterization and limit theory of max infinitely divisible and max stable processes, and random sets.\n",
      "a9000133 DMS $43490 The general objective of this project is to understand and to predict the surface structures and geometries of crystals which have been subjected to various kinds of thermal or mechanical treatments. The principal investigator is also interested in analyzing the behavior of defective crystals. These problems concentrate on areas that are the subject of intense work of material scientists but they escape the framework of classical mathematical theories. Therefore, accomplishing these goals is not only important for the industry and technology but it also contributes to the advance of mathematics, since it requires manipulation of very recently developed mathematical tools and maybe the introduction of new ones.\n",
      "a9000134 OCE $100917 Previous work by the Dr. Wells has demonstrated that organically bound aggregates of mineral grains are relatively common to estuarine water along the N. Carolina coast. These aggregates (>500 microns) are a food source for marine organisms, affect chemical distributions, and may be responsible for a substantial part of the vertical mass flux in shallow water. Few workers have been able to either observe or recover this \"marine snow\". Using techniques developed in their previous NSF award, Dr. Wells and his collaborator Dr. Luettich will analyze the in situ characteristics of these aggrregates. Transects of stations across Cape Lookout Bight will be re-occupied every 3 months for 2 years, vertical profiles will be re-occuppied every 3 months for 1 year, and moorings will be left in place for the duration of 3 \"northeaster\" storms. Photographs of aggregates, in situ measurements of aggregate settling velocities, and sensors recording a variety of water column propoerties on moorings and tethered cables will: 1) yield details about the size, shape and abundance of large aggregates in Cape Lookout Bight and Barden Inlet; 2) investigate the effect of currents on large aggregates; 3) provide settling velocities of aggregates; and 4) provide insight into the reponse of large aggregates to storm events and other seasonal phenomena.\n",
      "a9000135 OCE $135000 Since 1982, the California coast has seen an extraordinary number of very large scale disturbances in kelp beds. These resulted from the El Nino storm season of 1982-83, the very warm summer-fall seasons of 1983 and 1984 associated with the El Nino, the amphipod infestation of 1985, and the 200 year storm of 1988. During this period, a number of the algal successional processes were very different from what was observed during the 1970s. Data indicate that a major gap in understanding of the kelp forest's response to disturbance was information regarding the role of kelp reproduction during succession. This research project thus provides will allow controlled fertilizer experiments to test the role of nutrients in reproductive effort. An understanding of the parameters regulating kelp reproduction should explain many of the successional differences observed. The importance of long term ecological studies is becoming increasingly obvious to the understanding of disturbances of different scale and of kelp forest structures, some of which have persisted since 1971.\n",
      "a9000137 DMS $43500 The principal investigator will continue her studies of hydrodynamic and hydromagnetic waves of the type that occur in the earth's core. In particular, she will use eigenfunction analysis of the partial differential equations that describe oscillations in stratified, rotating, electrically conducting fluids and Hamiltonian techniques to study the stability of three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium states. The behavior of fluids inside of the earth is a very complicated problem whose solution involves the combined efforts of experimentalists and theoreticians. Essentially both groups study simplified models that regard the earth as a rotating ball of stratified, electrically conducting fluid inside of a magnetic field. The principal investigator is a theoretician who will investigate among other topics whether certain equilibrium states are stable to outside perturbations. Her work has relevance in geophysics and in the study of earthquakes.\n",

      "a9000144 OCE $375000 The long.term goal of the project is to identify and describe key processes which govern the abundance, composition and distribution of zooplankton in the ocean. Recent results on the relationship of copepod perception to clearance rate pointed to the significance of perception, and led to the main hypothesis, underlying the research proposed for the next three years. Both, signal perception performance, and the ability to respond to it, determines whether prey organisms avoid, escape from, or are captured by predators. This project will examine the behavior of various abundant prey (ciliates, copepod nauplii) and predators (nauplii, copepodites and adult copepods) found off the southeastern continental shelf of the U.S.A. The results will be used to taxonomically classify behaviors, and to calculate mortality rates for early juveniles of abundant species of copepods. Estimates of in situ mortality rates for early juveniles even of the most abundant copepod species are scarce and very difficult to obtain. The approach of quantifying species.specific, and stage.specific behaviors of motion, feeding, etc., in relation to sensor performance and morphology, will ultimately lead to an understanding of copepod existence and co.existence in the ocean. In combination with ecologically oriented efforts and parallel studies on the physiology of mechanosensors and chemosensors the proposed studies will aid in an understanding of what governs zooplankton behavior in the ocean.\n",
      "a9000146 OCE $592219 This research will define the basic mechanisms by which surfactants in marine waters affect the rate of gas exchange at the air-sea interface. Surfactants reduce gas exchange by altering the hydrodynamic structure of near-surface turbulence, and not by the formation of a monomolecular barrier. Reductions in gas exchange up to 50% have been observed in a variety of samples from synthetic surfactants to phytoplankton exudates and this reduction occurs under turbulent flow conditions. This research is aimed at a two step examination of the chemical and surface properties of surfactants as they relate to gas exchange processes. First, an experimental model relating the gas exchange coefficient Kw to the surface dilational modulus , the Schmidt number Sc and the friction velocity U*w, will be explored in a laboratory wind-wave tank. Second, the surface and organic chemistry of marine phytoplankton exudates will be described in relationship to their retarding effect on gas exchange. The overall results should improve our understanding of how surfactants of biogenic origin influence physical processes such as gas exchange in the ocean.\n",
      "a9000151 OCE $391738 This project will test several hypotheses regarding the control of oceanic primary productivity (primarily phytoplankton productivity) by varying the amounts of dissolved trace metals needed for growth (Fe, Mn and Zn) and also those which may be toxic and are often also present (Cu and Co). In nature the extent to which these metals are complexed by naturally occurring organic compounds may control their availability to the phytoplankton. This research will investigate several areas of the ocean which are underutilizing the dissolved nutrients nitrate and phosphate, perhaps because of lack of needed trace metals or excess of toxic trace metals. The experiments to be done will involve: 1) determining the concentrations of dissolved trace metals versus depth at several stations, and 2) at each station varying the amounts and availabilities of the trace metals Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu and Co in living phytoplankton cultures. The results of the second set of experiments will be compared with phytoplankton growth experiments wherein no additional metals have been added in order to quantify the magnitude of varying availabilities of the trace metals.\n",
      "a9000152 INT $11250 This award supports the participation of approximately ten young U.S. polymer scientists in a joint workshop with potential collaborators from the Federal Republic of Germany. Several industrial participants are expected, at their own expense. The meeting was co-organized by Dale S. Pearson of the University of California at Santa Barbara and Edwin L. Thomas of MIT together with Joachim Wendorff of the German Plastics Institute, Darmstadt, and Hans Kricheldorf from the Department of Applied and Macro- molecular Chemistry, University of Hamburg. The workshop will be held in a small village near Cologne, and will conclude with a tour and panel discussion at the new Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research at Mainz, FRG. This is a major new facility which indicates the strong interest of the German government and scientific community in polymer science. Prior bilateral meetings in this field (over three years ago and with different participants) resulted in a number of joint research projects, publications and arrangements for sabbaticals in Germany and the U.S. The small size of the meeting is particularly conducive for initiating close professional relationships among people who have not had an opportunity to meet before. The primary objective of the workshop is to address critical areas of polymer science through a well balanced program that includes contributions from chemistry, physics, materials science, and engineering. Presentations will be about evenly divided among polymer synthesis and modification, polymer characterization, and polymer theory. Particular emphasis will be given to two areas: synthetic research on electroactive polymers, a topic that has fostered intense collaboration between the physics and chemistry communities, and the more general but rapidly expanding area of polymer theory. Advances in theoretical concepts coupled with the increased availability of supercomputers are having a major impact on the way polymer scientists view macromolecular behavior. In addition, the participants will review progress in several areas included in previous meetings, such as liquid crystalline polymers, self-organizing systems, and polymer interfaces and surfaces. German research in polymer dynamics and surface characterization is among the best in the world due to their excellent facilities for neutron and X-ray scattering studies and some top-notch people.\n",
      "a9000153 OCE $455000 Theoretical and empirical studies of reproductive success and life-history evolution primarily focus on the regulation of female performance. This emphasis is justifiable only if it can be assumed that the determinants of male reproductive success are like those regulating female reproductive success. Yet, in virtually all multicellular organisms, there is substantial gender-specific variation in reproductive behavior, which leads to fundamental differences in the determinants of male and female reproductive success. One of the simplest and most phyletically widespread gender-specific differences in reproductive behavior is the retention of female gametes within the parent until some time after fertilization, and the broadcasting (or transfer by pollinators) of male gametes into air or water. This reproductive dichotomy potentially enhances levels of (1) intermale gametic competition, (2) gender-specific variance in pre-fertilization reproductive success, and (3) diversity of paternity within sibling relationships. Consequently, this sort of gender-specific variation in reproductive pattern potentially affects the intensity of sexual selection levels of gene flow, the structure of breeding systems, and the evolution of social behaviors. At present, virtually nothing is known about the determinants of male versus female reproductive success for any non-motile, aquatic invertebrate. This research will make direct field measurements of individual male (and, necessarily, female) reproductive success and dispersal in the colonial hydrozoan, Hydractinia milleri. DNA sequence analysis (i.e., DNA fingerprinting) to determine parent-offspring relationships of brooded larvae and adults that are members of, and recruit into, mapped populations over a three-year period. Data obtained from a combination of field and laboratory manipulations will allow an assessment of how colony density, size and proximity affect the relationship among reproductive investment, fertilization success, and reproductive success.\n",

      "a9000162 OCE $147936 Rich animal communities fueled by carbon producing microorganisms are known from a variety of reducing habitats at the deep-sea floor including vents, seeps, and organic-rich sediments; these habitats generally are linked to the boundaries between plates and/or areas of high coastal productivity. During a recent dive with the submersible, ALVIN, in the Catalina Basin, scientists discovered a community fueled by a novel source of reduced carbon compounds --- the skeleton of a 20-m long whale. Preliminary evidence suggests that whale remains may provide persistent and abundant reducing habitats with faunal communities similar to those of seeps, vents and organic-rich muds. However, the significance of whale-skeleton reducing habitats cannot be rigorously evaluated without much better knowledge of at least: (1) the source and flux rates of reducing compounds, (2) community composition (including vent-seep affinities), and (3) community dynamics (e.g., persistence times) associated with these carbon rich microbial systems. This research will provide a descriptive and experimental program, using the Catalina Basin whale-fall as a case study, to address these three topics.\n",

Observational techniques and modeling efforts have progressed to such a level that those studies are now feasible. Indeed, the CEDAR initiative in this country as well as the international World Ionosphere Thermosphere Study (WITS) and Solar-Terrestrial Energy Program (STEP) of SCOSTEP have been planned exactly in response to such a challenge. The World Acoustic Gravity Study (WAGS) is an important part of these programs. Acoustic gravity waves, and the associated traveling ionospheric disturbances (TIDS) have been the subject of many theoretical and experimental studies. A series of landmark theoretical papers by Hines (1960). Because of the large spatial coherence of the auroral- generated large-scale TIDs, it is imperative that world wide observational campaigns be conducted if one wants to study the overall source-generation-propagation mechanisms associated with these waves. WAGS was designed for this purpose.\n",

This project will be concerned with the study of the mechanism of key reactions of sulfenic and selenenic acids which are important and ubiquitous reactive intermediates in the chemistries of their respective elements. Another phase of the project will pursue additional avenues of investigation of elimination reactions leading to the formation of sulfines, and a third phase will explore in a systematic way the scope and dependence on reaction variables of a facile cleavage reaction of alpha-sulfonyl sulfides by nucleophiles. The project will involve a search for more definitive evidence for the presence of hypervalent sulfur intermediates on the reaction coordinate of nucleophilic substitutions at sulfur using reactions of oxyanions with selected thiosulfinates and thiosulfonates.\n",
      "a9000177 OCE $176836 In January 1988 a seismic tomography experiment was carried out on the East Pacific Rise at 9 degrees 30'N to image in three- dimensions the seismic velocity structure of the rise axis. This experiment yielded a seismic data set consisting of more that 8000 records from approximately 500 shots and 15 ocean bottom seismometers. Initial results from the tomographic inversion of P wave delay times indicate substantial heterogeneity in structure both across and along the rise axis; for instance, the axial low velocity anomaly at 2 km depth is 1.5km/s slower than off axis; the along-axis variations in this velocity anomaly exceed 20%. This renewal will continue the investigation of seismic velocity models using improved inversion techniques, will explore methods of utilizing waveform amplitude information to constrain further the 3-D seismic structure, and will analyze and interpret the gravity, magnetic, and microearthquake data obtained during the course of the tomography experiment.\n",
      "a9000182 OCE $163246 The calculation of paleomagnetic poles from seamount magnetic anomalies involves several simplifying assumptions concerning the source of magnetization of the seamount.

Dredge samples from Jasper seamount and oriented samples from an uplifted seamount sequence exposed on La Palma, Canary islands were studied. This study will continue to: 1) augment the data set with analyses from several other seamounts and oceanic island exposures to assess the general applicability of the current data set, 2) characterize further the geological, mineralogical, and geochemical boundary conditions for the samples already analyzed, 3) study the effects of metamorphism on magnetic properties, and 4) apply the results to the analysis of seamount magnetic anomaly data.\n",

Detailed petrologic and geochemical studies of well-studied and well-sampled ridge segments can provides strong constraints on the nature and geometry of these processes. This project will analyze trace element, mineral chemistry, and crystal size distribution data from the East Pacific Rise between 9 degree 20 minutes North and 9 degrees 53 minutes North to test models of magma transport and magma chamber processes. One model of mid-ocean ridge volcanism considers the volcanism to be the result of deep upwelling which degenerates upward into multiple diapirs and conduits. At shallow levels magmas apparently undergo fractionation with rocks crystallized from high-temperature melts forming at local ridge-crest highs and rocks crystallizing form low-temperature melts found at ridge-crest lows. This model will be tested by comparing analyses from extensive dredge hauls to calculations of rock compositions that would be expected from a fractionation of one or more parent magmas.\n",

      "a9000197 EAR $76748 This is a collaborative project between James Natland of Scripps Institution, and Fred Frey of MIT. It is an integrated textural, mineralogical, and geochemical study of ultramafic xenoliths and their host lavas from the Samoan, Society, and Marquesas Islands in the southwest Pacific. The xenoliths are in existing collections, and preliminary mineralogical and isotopic work demonstrates that they are related to processed of partial melting and magmatic differentiation beneath these volcanoes. The island chains contain some of the most enriched basaltic lavas in the ocean basins, which are hypothesized to be related to a regionally widespread, perhaps hemispheric, geochemical anomaly in the mantle. Xenoliths should provide complementary information on the compositions of mantle sources, the action of metasomatic processes in influencing or modifying source compositions, and the processes of melt extraction and magmatic differentiation in and near the source regions of ocean-island basalts. Studies so far indicate that both residual (Type 1) and \"cumulate\" (Type 2) xenoliths are present in all three island chains, and that substantial degrees of partial melting produced possible tholeiitic magmas which crystallized olivine-spinel- pyroxene assemblages en route from the mantle. Such lavas may comprise much of the voluminous, submerged, but still unsampled portions of these volcanoes. Principal techniques to be applied to the xenoliths will be 1) petrography; 2) electron-probe microanalysis of mineral phases; 3) ion-probe analysis of trace-element abundances in minerals, and 4) a combination of mass spectrometry (conventional solid- source and ICP-MS), XRF, and instrumental neutron-activation analysis for whole-rocks and mineral separates. Steps 1 and 2 will be used to select the appropriate range of samples for detailed ion-probe, isotope, and trace-element studies. Bulk chemical, trace-element, and isotopic measurements will be made on host lavas and these related to temporal successions on the islands, which are already known. Comparisons will also be made to published information on continental and Hawaiian xenolith suites.\n",
      "a9000200 SES $71832 The work generalizes switching regression models and limited dependent variable models in order to apply them in a dynamic context. Using the Panel Survey on Income Dynamics, the investigators will estimate the parameters of a lifecycle model involving Euler equations. Incorporated in this model will be the assumptions of a lifetime budget constraint as well as a liquidity constraint. One of the important developments in this research is the use of the method of simulated scores to estimate the model. Households do appear to switch their consumption and labor supply patterns over long periods. They are likely to be constrained early on in their lifetime, at the time of major purchases or unforseen events (such as unemployment, catastrophic illness, etc). The incorporation of the endogeneity and imperfect observability of liquidity constraints in the type of model that is being estimated will make it easier to confirm the importance of these constraints on household behavior. Because of the methods used, the techniques can be generalized to the constraints that firms face, as well.\n",

Dr. Caron and colleagues will simultaneously examine the ecological role of the entire assemblage of these three protozoa. Their research examines two hypotheses: 1. In nutrient-poor oceanic environments, the symbiont primary production in the entire population of acantharia, polycystine radiolaria and foraminifera will represent a significant fraction of the total primary production and will dominate the production by large cells (operationally defined as cells larger than 74um). 2. Sarcodines will be a disproportionately important component of sinking material from the euphotic zone compared with their suspended biomass. Symbiont production rates of the entire population of symbiont-bearing sarcodines are determined through a combination of large volume and diver-collected production measurements to evaluate the importance of this production relative to total primary production. The significance of these planktonic protists for the vertical flux of material is estimated by the concurrent measurement of both the stocks of sarcodines and the rate of sinking export. These measurements are coordinated with the GOFS Time-Series Study at Bermuda (participation in two cruises per year), which enables the investigators to view their results from a large, seasonal perspective.\n",

      "a9000206 OCE $159250 This project will examine a recently discovered midwater community that dominates the open water realm at night over the upper slope of the Hawaiian Islands. This distinctive boundary community is found in waters over bottom depths of approximately 400.700 m and appears to undergo diel vertical migration followed by horizontal migrations into the outer coastal (i.e. the 100m bottom depth) habitat. The major objective of this study is to define clearly the habitat requirements of this community and to determine the extent and magnitude of the inshore.offshore distributions and, thereby, the extent and magnitude of horizontal movements or migrations, and (2) the effect of differing slope bathymetry on the relative abundance of species, the overall abundance of the animals, and on the patterns of horizontal movement. The sampling strategy includes quantitative sampling with large nets, real.time observations of the fauna as revealed by a sonar system and \u001ain\u001a \u001asitu\u001a observations to confirm the daytime habitat of the fauna using the PISCES V submersible.

      "a9000214 OPP $206773 The Huanghe (Yellow River) is one of the world's largest in terms of sediment discharge to the ocean (approximately 1.1 billion tons per year) and largest in terms of suspended matter concentration 25 grams per liter. This award will allow retrieval of both river and estuarine data for the Huanghe. The former data set includes measurements of average daily discharge (of water and sediment) at a number of selected stations along the river, from above the loess hills that form the primary sediment source downstream to Kenli (20 kilometers from the river mouth). The estuarine data include hydrographic, current meter and suspend matter observations and samples collected synoptically during three cruises 1984 and 1987 for periods of 2 to 3 days. The river and estuary data both include several stations across the channel cross section, thus allowing proper width-and- averages to be calculated and compared with numerical models. These unique data sets will allow characterization of transport patterns of the Huanghe along its path with respect to time and distance as well as discharge patterns into the adjacent Gulf of Bohai. The present study focuses primarily on the estuary itself: how the sediment discharged at its head propagates through the estuary and is discharged to the delta front.\n",

      "a9000255 ANI $1 The New England region has a high concentration of research, educational, and entrepreneurial organizations. This concentration has created a heavy demand for network communication services to facilitate the exchange of information and ideas, both within the region and with colleagues in other parts of the nation and even internationally. Recognizing this need, Boston University, Harvard University, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have spearheaded the formation of a regional network to improve communication services. The network, the New England Academic and Research Network (NEARNET), has 21 member organizations and is growing rapidly. Its current connection to the NSFNET backbone is shared with other JVNCNET users in the Northeast and increases the hopcount between NEARNET's most remote members and the backbone point of presence by as much as a factor of two. An additional backbone node located at MIT would provide more reliable, faster service to New England users of NSF facilities, such as supercomputers, and would make the unique resources that this region has to offer more accessible to the NSFNET community. This significantly improved access will be a catalyst for the development of the \"information infrastructure\" in New England.***\n",
      "a9000256 DMS $130750 This award supports the research in automorphic forms and representation theory of Professor Freydoon Shahidi of Purdue University. One of Dr. Shahidi's projects is to study the possible equivalence, for a cusp form on a quasi-split group over a number field, between having a non-zero Fourier coefficient with respect to a generic character of a maximal unipotent subgroup, and having generic local components everywhere. Another related project is to prove the holomorphy of certain local L- functions related to tempered representations. Non-Euclidean plane geometry began in the early nineteenth century as a mathematical curiosity, but by the end of that century, mathematicians had realized that many objects of fundamental importance are non-Euclidean in their basic nature. The detailed study of non-Euclidean plane geometries has given rise to several branches of modern mathematics, of which the study of modular and automorphic forms is one of the most active. This field is principally concerned with questions about the whole numbers, but in its use of geometry and analysis, it retains connection to its historical roots.\n",

      "a9000263 OCE $317970 The nitrate supply to the euphotic layer plays a key role in oceanic (and therefore global) carbon fluxes. Since ultraphytoplankton dominate these waters, their nitrate uptake arguably controls these processes. However, it is now believed that episodic nitrate pulses provide a significant fraction of the total annual primary productivity in the central gyres, yet the response of ultraphytoplankters to ecologically significant nitrate perturbations in nitrate concentration is likely to be a factor in species success of oceanic ultraphytoplankters. Drs Glover and Garside will characterize the kinetic response of oceanic algal and Synechococcus clones of ultraphytoplanton to ecologically significant (Nanomolar) increases in nitrate, using the chemiluminescent method. Experiments will involve measuring nitrate uptake, on a subsample of a nitrate-limited chemostat culture, exposed to different nitrate concentrations, but under the same temperature and light conditions as the parent culture. Their studies will contribute to understanding physical, chemical and physiological interactions that integrate to mediate 'new' nitrate-based production and ultimately control the oceans as a CO2 sink.\n",
      "a9000264 OCE $147000 This research builds on previous findings that qualitative and quantitative differences exist in the secondary metabolites produced by kelp-like plants between the temperate northeast and southwest Pacific regions. The purpose of the research is to: 1) further document variation in the levels and kinds of secondary chemicals among large brown algae from California and New Zealand, and 2) determine behavioral and long term responses of selected marine plant-eating invertebrates to these compounds. Extensive collections will be made from both areas to document variation in concentrations of polyphenolic and lipophilic compounds among the common brown algal species; among individuals and tissues within species; and through time in detached plants. Feeding preferences of common sea urchins and snails from both regions will be tested for the effects of these secondary compounds by measuring variation in consumption rate. Physiological influences of secondary metabolites on various plant-eating invertebrates will be evaluated by measuring absorption efficiencies, growth rates, and gonadal development among experimental treatments in which the kinds and levels of secondary metabolites are varied. Hypothetically interactions between algae and the animals which consume them will differ among these regions in two important ways: 1) the amount and diversity of chemical defenses in New Zealand algae will be greater than in California species; and 2) the algae eaters in New Zealand will be more tolerant of polyphenolics than will similar algal consuming invertebrates from California. Overall, the mechanisms which mediate transfer of energy from the algae which are the dominant primary producers on temperate rocky shores to the invertebrates which consume them are predicted to vary greatly on a biogeographical scale.\n",

      "a9000280 DMS $20000 This project continues mathematical investigations in the field of ordinary differential equations. The object is to study the formal power series solutions of algebraic differential equations. Specifically, the work will concentrate on power series of Gevrey type in which the coefficients are not greater than certain bounds depending only on the index of the coefficient and a single parameter. The source of the questions undertaken here is a paper of 1903 which gives conditions on a equation which ensure that a solution may be expressed by such a power series. Every subsequent proof of this result requires recurrence formulas of exceptional complexity in which the best value of the parameter is all but impossible to estimate. A new approach to the problem has recently been uncovered which provides good results in the linear setting. Work to be done will now focus on nonlinear equations and singular perturbations of regular equations in which the coefficient estimates are expected to be sharp.\n",

This work will provide new insights into the nature of short-lived intermediates that are formed in the course of chemical reactions and will also develop new approaches to chemical measurements using a \"molecular-size construction set\". The experiments that will be carried out by Dr. Michl fall into two categories. The first is focused on biradical intermediates, which will be generated by photolytic or pyrolytic processes and then be trapped in a low-temperature, inert-gas matrix. Electronic and vibrational spectroscopic studies will afford an improved understanding of the structure and reactivity of these unstable species. The second category is centered on Michl's staffane hydrocarbons, which are rod-like molecules made up of recurring bicyclo?1.1.1!pentane subunits. These \"molecular Tinkertoys\" provide a unique opportunity for studying the transmission of electronic effects through a molecular framework. Professor Michl will also take advantage of the linear shape of these molecules to link these molecules together and form supramolecular assemblies with well-defined molecular structures.\n",

      "a9000305 OCE $226344 Near shore and continental shelf areas are significantly more supersaturated with CH4 than are the open oceans, yet global CH4 budgets ignore this fact because of the paucity of data. Investigations of the near shore regions of Washington and Oregon, particularly those areas influenced by the Columbia River plume and evaluations of the impact of this plume on the rate of CH4 evasion to the atmosphere will help to construct accurate CH4 budgets. The lower Columbia River is, on average, supersaturaterd with methane by a factor of 120. There is also an active population of methane oxidizing bacteria within the river with an average consumption rate of 20 nM methane per day. Preliminary evidence indicates that within the estuary, as the salinity increases above about 5 parts per thousand, this microbial activity ceases. This study will determine whether a marine population of methane oxidizing organisms becomes established as the Columbia River plume moves downstream and consumes the residual methane or if the riverine supply of methane is completely evaded to the atmosphere. Ths study is relevant to all river systems and is of significance to current attempts to develop a methane budget for the oceans.\n",
      "a9000306 IBN $23910 Decisions made by animals are affected by numerous factors. For example, a bird's choice among different food items can be shown to be affected by how hungry the bird is, the relative abundance of food types, the sequence of previous encounters with different food items, and the amount of fat reserves the bird has stored. Until now, it has proved difficult, both theoretically and experimentally, to study the combined effects of these factors in a meaningful way. As a result, only a small fraction of the rich diversity of responses that animals exhibit have been studied. The current pilot project is designed to test techniques that will allow a more synoptic view of animal decision-making. Specifically, Dr. Lucas plans to test several predictions of caching behavior by Carolina chickadees under laboratory conditions. Chickadees store food items singly in hundreds of different sites and retrieve this food within a period of days. The predictions, derived from a dynamic-programming model, will be tested by continuously monitoring body mass, cache size and caching decisions throughout the day. Monitoring will be accomplished using computer-driven electronic balances and remote sensors in potential cache sites. This work is important because it provides a methodology for understanding behavior in a broad context. Decisions should reflect a balance of costs and benefits associated with alternative behaviors available to the animal. The costs and benefits, in turn, are affected by current conditions and expected changes in these conditions. This is as relevant to human behavior as it is to the behavior of non-human animals. Caching behavior is particularly revealing because, by caching food, the animal is providing for future nutritional requirements (when the food is retrieved) to the detriment of current requirements (which could be satisfied by eating discovered food immediately). Thus, caching decisions should reflect current conditions and expected changes in those conditions when the food is finally retrieved.\n",

Like the past work on aluminum reactions, due attention will be paid to the fundamental aspects of the results. The temperature range to be investigated is 900 to 1900 K, with pressures form 10-2 to 1.0 bar. The formation of metal compounds in incineration, whether as particulates or gaseous emissions, has been identified as an important economic and health problem.

The R/V ALPHA HELIX is a 133'general research vessel constructed 1966. The vessel is owned by the National Science Foundation, and operated by the University of Alaska under a 5-year renewable charter. The ship will operate mainly in the coastal waters of Alaska, Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea. This vessel is part of a fleet used by the National Science Foundation to support oceanographic research projects. Most oceanographic research projects require highly specialized equipment and extensive support from a ship's crew members. An increasing number of research projects require equipment that must be permanently installed on a ship and for which the ship must be specifically designed. Such equipment also requires highly trained crew members for maintenance and operation. These vessels do not operate in the same manner as general cargo or fishing vessels, and therefore, NSF supports the operation of a variety of vessels specifically dedicated to oceanographic research. These vessels are operated by universities and research institutions around the country. The program recognizes the importance of the R/V ALPHA HELIX to the research fleet because it is the only vessel located in an Arctic region. Great interest has been generated in the Arctic region during the past few years as Global Change became an important issue. Continued operations of a research vessel in the Arctic region is critical, and improvement of our Arctic research capabilities is recommended. Although the R/V ALPHA HELIX has a slight amount of ice strengthening that allows it to operate near ice, the vessel is not capable of true ice operations.\n",
      "a9000323 OCE $188297 During the preceeding grant periods, the instrumentation required to perform in situ benthic flux chamber measurements and to retrieve and maintain sediment cores at in situ temperatures and pressures during shipboard pore water sampling and incubations were developed. This project will utilize these instruments to study two important aspects of the marine carbon cycle, the mineralization of organic matter and the kinetics of CaCO3 dissolution in deep sea surface sediments. Specifically, sites adjacent to the highly productive west African margin (in collaboration with the French-sponsored EUMELI program) and sites above and below the lysocline in the western equatorial Pacific will be studied. At each location, the particulate input of organic matter, opal, and CaCO3, the mineralization and dissolution rate of these phases in surface sediments, and the burial rate will be determined. This information, when coupled through models to environmental parameters such as bottom water CaCO3 saturation state, diffusive boundary layer thickness, etc., will permit the following questions to be addressed: 1. Are organic matter fluxes to the seafloor off Africa important to deep Atlantic carbon budgets? 2. Can organic matter fluxes off Africa be supported by vertical rain rates as measured by sediment traps? 3. Is denitrification at the deep seafloor important off west Africa? 4. What is the CaCO3 dissolution rate constant at the seafloor? 5. To what extent is metabolic CO2 neutralized by the dissolution of sedimentary CaCO3? 6. Does transport across the diffusive sublayer limit the total CaCO3 dissolution rate in the deep sea?\n",
      "a9000325 ATM $337347 The goal of this project is to assess the role played in tropical cyclone formation by eddy momentum fluxes associated with upper tropospheric waves and by wind surges in the lower troposphere. Earlier studies by the PI indicate that the fluxes induce the radial circulation which draws warm, moist air inward and concentrates the area of convection in developing atmospheric disturbances, leading to hurricane formation. The principal research method involves numerical modeling of developing and non-developing disturbances and diagnosis of the model runs. Under his previous award, the PI used composite data (a combination of data from a number of cases) for the Atlantic region. Under this award, the PI will investigate individual cases, using data for the northwest Pacific region. A new research emphasis for this project is the investigation of the role of low level wind surges.\n",

The ESP's and SSP'shave been inverted for compressional wave velocity using travel-time information. The PI's now propose to implement two full waveform inversion techniques and apply these to ESP and SSP data from the Nankai Trough. They will apply both a layer-stripping inversion method and an iterative forward modeling cheme to evaluate their performane. These inversions will result in a more detailed estimate of compressional wave velocity, density, and possibly shear wavy velocity. These quantities will then be used to construct two transects of sediment physical properties in the zone of maximum strain near the base of the trench.\n",
      "a9000329 CHE $267700 Lasers emit a narrow beam of coherent, powerful and nearly monochromatic electromagntic radiation. This intense beam of coherent visible and infrared light excites the atoms of the optical resonator to a higher energy level and the resonator forces the excited atoms to radiate in phase. Lasers are useful in optics, communication, and engineering. This award from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program will help the Department of Chemistry at Princeton University purchase laser equipment. This equipment will be used in the following research activities: a) High Power Pulse Shaping for Laser Selective Chemistry b) Photodissociation and Molecular Relaxation in Molecular Beams of Clusters c) Time-dependent Study of Intramolecular Energy Flows d) Structural and Dynamics in Proteins and Metalloporphyrins e) Structure and Dynamics of Biomimetic Multiheme Assemblies f) Fast Reactions at Electrodes g) Motional Dynamics in DNA\n",
      "a9000333 OCE $37522 In the summer of 1988 the principal investigator measured microseismicity in and near the hydrothermal vent field of the Endeavor segment of the Juan de Fuca Ridge. A very surprising result was the large number (hundreds) of seismic events that were observed. The principal investigator thinks he has made the first observation of long duration tremor associated with a submarine hydrothermal field. The large number and unusual nature of these events make this data set unique. The principal investigator will: 1) construct a number-of-events vs. relative magnitude curve for as many events as possible; 2) characterize the spectra of the events; and 3) analyze the time variability of the events and compare with high-frequency data from near an active hydrothermal chimney.\n",
      "a9000339 DMS $33270 This work divides into two main topics, propagation of conormal singularities in nonlinear caustics and the propagation of the same type of singularities in nonlinear diffraction. Underlying this research is the general question of how the past wavefront set of a solution of a differential equation influences the wavefront set in the future. In the first project, work will be done investigating the propagation of conormal singularities of solutions to the Cauchy problem for second order strictly hyperbolic equations in three space dimensions. The initial data is assumed to be conormal to the smooth part of a characteristic hypersurface with a swallowtail singularity. One object of this study will be to show that there is at most a cone of anomalous singularities propagating from the swallowtail point. In the second project, the propagation of conormal singularities for semilinear hyperbolic mixed problems with Dirichlet conditions on domains with diffractive boundaries will be considered. Here, the object will be to show that there is at most a cone of anomalous singularities propagating from the glancing points.\n",
      "a9000343 OCE $1153600 Texas A & M University will operate the R/V GYRE during 1990 as a general oceanographic vessel in support of NSF-funded research projects. The GYRE is a 182' general research vessel constructed by the U.S. Navy in 1973 and modified in 1980 and 1984. Texas A&M operates the GYRE under a charter agreement effective for five years from 1 March 1989. The ship operates primarily in the Gulf of Mexico and northeastern Atlantic. This vessel is part of a fleet used by the National Science Foundation to support oceanographic research projects. Most oceanographic research projects require highly specialized equipment and extensive support from a ship's crew members. An increasing number of research projects require equipment that must be permanently installed on a ship and for which the ship must be specifically designed. Such equipment also requires highly trained crew members for maintenance and operation. These vessels do not operate in the same manner as general cargo or fishing vessels, and therefore, NSF supports the operation of a variety of vessels specifically dedicated to oceanographic research. These vessels are operated by universities and research institutions around the country.\n",
      "a9000344 CHE $558088 The Organic Synthesis Program is funding this research. Dr. Meyers will continue his very fruitful development of new methods for synthesizing optically active materials. Many of the molecules used in treating diseases are optically active and this work has the potential to provide new routes for their synthesis. Metalation of chiral formamidines using butyllithiums, followed by alkylation with various electrophiles, gives C-C bonds adjacent to nitrogen in very high enantioselectivity. This process has now entered the advanced stage whereby complex alkaloids and other nitrogen-containing substances are being explored. Future efforts will center on quaternary carbon derivatives and attempts to reach a number of spiroisoquinoline alkaloids in high enantiomeric excess. A search for more efficient and readily available chiral auxiliaries will also be undertaken to increase the % ee's of the quaternary alkylated products. In addition to the quaternary carbon stereocenters, asymmetric total syntheses will be attempted at suitable targets of biological importance. Other studies will focus on mechanistic aspects of this process using Li-NMR, molecular modeling, and isotopic derivatives in an effort to clarify the nature and reactivity of the organolithium intermediates. Finally, mechanistic information, already in hand, has provided a clue that facile resolutions may be accomplished as an alternative means of reaching these optically active amines.\n",

Live and preserved animals, fresh tissues and other materials derived from Peromyscus are provided to the scientific community as a national resource. This project will allow expansion of the Center to include live stocks of three additional species as well as molecular materials of Peromyscus origin. The Center will be extended to include any genetic resources relating to Peromyscus, including purified nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, molecular probes, genomic and cDNA libraries, cell lines, skins of variant types, photographs, research and pedigree records and publication reprints, all of which will be available from this central source. The Center will also add at least six behavioral mutant lines, and will establish a backup colony at a remote site in case of a catastrophic disaster.

      "a9000353 CHE $235000 The Synthetic Organic Program is funding Dr. Paul Helquist of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Notre Dame to continue his research on new methods in synthetic organic and organometallic chemistry. The important unifying themes among the subprojects are the construction of carbocyclic ring systems, the development of organometallic reagents with a special emphasis on transition metals, and the development of reactions that take place with asymmetric induction. First, iron-carbene complexes will be studied to test the ability of these reactive intermediates to undergo C-H insertion and cationic olefinic cyclization. Chiral-at-iron derivatives will be used to test aysmmetric versions of the reactions. Second, intermediates derived from the reaction between ketone enolates and cyclopropane derivatives will be used as precursors cyclopentanone annulation, formation of polycyclic fused cycloheptanone systems and three-carbon segments for the synthesis of large-ring systems. Third, the concept of diastereofacial selective coordination of alkenes and the subsequent use of the coordinated alkenes for chiral synthesis will be extended to include organic pi-donor ligands in general.\n",

      "a9000360 DBI $349353 This award provides funds for the further development of the use of Nuclear Magnetic resonance (NMR) for studies of the 3 dimensional structure of proteins and nucleic acids in solution. The approach developed by Gorenstein and his colleagues, the hybrid matrix/complete relaxation matrix program (or MORASS), has proven highly productive. Planned work should increase the accuracy and ease of application of these techniques. Determination of the three dimensional structure of biopolymers such as proteins and nucleic acids, and its relationship to the biological function of the polymers, is a central problem in modern biology. The most successful approach to the study of large molecules like proteins has come with the use of crystallographic methods. These methods, however, are limited to study of the highly ordered structures found in crystals; the results may or may not be directly applicable to the structure of (active) molecules in solution. Many investigators now see the use of NMR as the most promising approach to studies of the solution structure of a variety of biomolecules. However, further refinement of experimental techniques and the analytical tools needed for interpretation of the spectroscopic data is crucial to progress in the application of this powerful tool.\n",
      "a9000365 INT $21250 The geology of the southern Canadian Shield is remarkably similar to that of the eastern Baltic Shield in many aspects, including rock types, rock ages, and tectonic histories. It is possible that the two shields were at one time in proximity to each other and may even have been located on the same supercontinent. Whereas papers from Swedish and Finnish geologists on the western Baltic Shield have been available, until now the findings of Soviet geologists on the eastern Baltic Shield have not been accessible. This workshop, co- organized by Dr. Richard Ojakangas of the University of Minnesota-Duluth and Dr. Sergey Rybakov of the Institute of Geology of the Karelian Branch of the Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R. in Petrozavodsk, will provide an opportunity for American and Soviet experts to exchange ideas and to evaluate and develop plans for long-term cooperation in this area. The workshop will also involve geological field trips in Minnesota, Michigan, Wisconsin, and adjacent Canada. This project fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading researchers in the United States and the U.S.S.R. to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence in the field of basic scientific research on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.\n",
      "a9000367 DEB $14400 Biological recycling of phosphorus (P) in surficial organic horizons has been suggested as an important mechanism maintaining soil P availability in some tropical forests. A similar mechanism has been proposed for some temperate forests, but no direct evidence has been gathered with respect to this surmise. More recent studies suggest that high densities of microorganisms in tropical forest floors may actually inhibit plant uptake, and that P might be particularly susceptible to leaching in organic form. Preliminary investigations at the Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory in North Carolina have shown strong geochemical P adsorption in all mineral soil horizons and the importance of microbial immobilization in the forest floor, suggesting that forest floor organic matter also inhibits geochemical adsorption. Collectively, these data strongly suggest that tight biological control of P cycling in the forest may contribute significantly in maintaining long-term P availability in these southern Appalachian forests. Research sponsored by a two-year postdoctoral fellowship award will allow tests of the \"biological control\" hypothesis by means of a series of laboratory and field radiotracer experiments. Specific objectives are to determine the relative importance of microbial immobilization, plant/mycorrhizal uptake, and mineral adsorption in controlling P dynamics in forest floor and mineral horizons of a temperate deciduous forest soil, and to examine vertical movement of organic and inorganic P. The Fellow's host institution for the study is Duke University.\n",
      "a9000369 DMS $171300 Six problems are posed about hyperplane arrangements A defined by a product Q of linear forms in a vector space V. (1) The polynomial map Q has a non-isolated singularity at the origin. Let F be its Milnor fiber. Compute the cohomology of F for a generic arrangement. (2) It has been conjectured that if A is free, then the restriction of A to a subspace in its lattice is again free. Investigate this conjecture for Coxeter arrangements. (3) Known results on Hessians and discriminants of Shephard groups will be combined with ideas of Saito to give a case-free proof of the existence of flat basic invariants for Shephard groups, and to explain why the complements of their reflection arrangements are K(G,1)-spaces. (4) Let S be the algebra of polynomial functions on V and let J be the Jacobian ideal generated by the partial derivatives of Q. If A is generic, then the homological dimension of S/J is equal to dimV. Study the homological dimension of S/J for all arrangements. (5) Given H in A let B denote the restriction of A to H. There is a natural restriction of the derivations tangent to A to the derivations tangent to B. This map is surjective in some cases and not surjective in others. Find precise conditions for surjectivity. (6) Subspace arrangements will be studied with respect to the question of additivity of the Poincare polynomial under deletion and restriction. The use of computers, to furnish experimental material, is implicit in the work. These six problems show that in high dimensions the ways in which a finite number of linear spaces can be imbedded in a linear space of one greater dimension exhibits a surprisingly rich structure. Standard tools of topology are well adapted to elucidating this structure and will be further exploited.\n",

The field team will obtain complete undisturbed sediment records from six strategically located arctic lakes. Fossil pollen and diatom analyses will provide two independent well-dated paleoclimated records for each lake. The new paleoclimatic time series will be combined with published and unpublished data to generate a 100 + site network of plaeoclimate records for the region. This network will be used to map 1) past vegetation change and 2) past climate change over a significant portion of the North American arctic. This investigation will also provide an opportunity to test the utility of annually laminated sediments for arctic paleoclimatology. This effort will provide important new data for inclusion in the eventual mapping and analysis of past environmental change across the entire North Arctic.\n",

      "a9000375 PHY $111787 A program of high resolution measurements on simple atoms and molecules will be continued, concentrating especially on the two-electron systems molecular hydrogen and atomic helium. The experimental methods involve multiphoton excitation of both ground state and metastable species. A pulse-amplified cw dye laser is used to obtain the high powers required for multiphoton excitation while retaining high resolution. The dissociation energy and ionization potential of hydrogen will be determined to a new accuracy, and improved measurements will be made of the structure of helium. These measurements will provide the first stringent tests of calculations of quantum electrodynamic effects in the ground states of two-electron systems. Microwave-optical double resonance will be used to precisely measure transitions between high Rydberg states. A major focus on this research will be the interaction of excited states in hydrogen with the ionization and dissociation continua, including the effects of doubly excited states. The decay of Rydberg states will be studied both with and without external electric fields. Work will continue on the photodissociation of hydrogen very near threshold, which yields detailed information on long-range interactions between atoms.\n",

Dr. Truemper's project is to develop new methods of matroid decomposition, and also to apply the body of matroid theory to the task of producing an algorithmic problem solver or program generator that will, in most cases, produce highly efficient solutions to particular problems in a given NP-hard class. This research falls in the broad category of combinatorics, which is one of the most active fields in today's mathematics. Fundamentally, combinatorics represents a systematization of the very first of all mathematical activities, counting. In its modern development, however, combinatorics has gone beyond just counting to make use of a wide variety of advanced mathematical techniques, and although its roots go back several centuries, the field has had an explosive development in the past few decades because of its importance in communications and information technology.\n",
      "a9000378 CMS $223376 Water-saturated sandy soils are susceptible to liquefaction when subjected to strong ground shaking, such as occurs during an earthquake. Liquefied soils experience a decrease in bearing strength: this can lead to the partial or total collapse of buildings standing on liquefied soils. The aim of this project is to verify the analyses used to predict liquefaction due to earthquake loading. Since the field data needed for this verification is extremely difficult to obtain, data is being used instead from laboratory experiments performed on geotechnical centrifuges. This is a relatively new technique for soil testing which is becoming well accepted in the geotechnical research community. The technique for simulating earthquakes on centrifuges is being developed, and the results obtained have generated confidence in the method: questions that remain to be answered are being addressed in this study. Different geotechnical structures, including sloping ground, dams, coastal dikes, and embankments are being investigated so as to validate the applicability of the liquefaction analysis methods to a variety of geotechnical structures. Class A predictions - which involve predicting the soil response without knowing the measured results - are used for later comparison with measured results. The Earth Technology Corporation is responsible for the management of the project, for providing carefully calibrated soil samples, for overseeing the testing program, as well as being responsible for receiving, distributing and documenting data, in conjunction with the Adjudication Committee. It is also responsible for managing the prediction studies. The Adjudication Committee acts as an independent steering group. The participating institutions are the University of California at Davis and Berkeley, the California Institute of Technology, the University of Colorado, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Princeton University, and Cambridge University, England. Collectively, they are examining the mechanisms of liquefaction, the development and verification of analytical and numerical models, soil-structure interaction for conditions of limited and large deformations, and the effect of interfaces between soil layers of differing permeabilities.

      "a9000407 BCS $300000 ABSTRACT This project is concerned with the study of visual gestural languages, primary linguistic systems that are not derivative from spoken language. The existence of such fully expressive systems arising outside the mainstream of spoken languages affords a new vantage point for investigating biological constraints on linguistic form. The research centers around the structured use of space and movement in the grammatical processes of signed languages. The investigator couples new linguistic analyses with powerful techniques for three dimensional computergraphic analysis in a series of experiments on the neurological control of language and movement. The experiments probe signers with deficits at different levels of linguistic representation and motor control, examining the neurological control of language and movement through the quantitative analysis of the breakdown of both. The convergence of formal linguistic, objective three- dimensional measurement, and neurological approaches will provide unique information about the functional anatomy of language itself.\n",

To date, the authors have conducted neutron activation analyses on 325 samples spanning 70 Ma of sediment in core LL4-GPC3 from the central N Pacific. They developed an inverse modeling technique that juggles the 39 elements analyzed in this core to match 8 end-member sediment components. From this is emerging a history of eolian, volcanic, hydrothermal, hydrogenous and biologic contribution to the Pacific ocean basin. With the present award, Drs. Kyte and Leinen will extend these analyses and modeling techniques to another long record (DSDP Site 576 in the western N Pacific) and will incorporate parallel mineralogic (XRD) analyses on surface sediments from throughout the N Pacific. The goal is to refine their understanding of the chemical and mineralogical controls on the distribution of major, minor + trace elements in N Pacific sediments, and continue to develop this technique as a new approach in paleoenvironmental interpretation.\n",

      "a9000412 DMS $35837 Professor Assani's research will focus on three problems. They are connected to operator theory, ergodic theory, and harmonic analysis. I) Is it possible to extend the recent result of J. Bourgain on the return times of dynamical systems to an operator theoretic context? II) Can a spectral characterization of the approximate transitivity property introduced by Connes and Woods be obtained? III) What kinds of operators have iterates which when acting on a function converge almost everywhere? This project involves research in ergodic theory. Ergodic theory in general concerns understanding the average behavior of systems whose dynamics is too complicated or chaotic to be followed in microscopic detail. Under the heading \"dynamics\" can be placed the modern theory of how groups of abstract transformations act on smooth spaces. In addition ergodic theory makes contact with operator theory and harmonic analysis when the dynamics consists of applying a single transformation again and again.\n",

This conference will bring together the leading mathematical scientists in the fields mentioned in the title to discuss mathematics at the forefront of these subjects with a wide group of participants. These fields have frequently benefitted from a cross-fertilization of ideas and techniques, so the effect of this interdisciplinary conference should lead to new advances in the respective fields.

      "a9000418 DMS $32497 The study of partial differential equations of three types motivates this work, which combines methods of harmonic and classical analysis in treating the problems outlined in the research plan. It is well known that the free Schrodinger operator defined on Euclidean space of any dimension maps integrable functions into bounded functions whose bound decays with reciprocal powers of time. Global existence for some non-linear Schrodinger equations with small initial data as well as results in scattering theory derive from this fact. The estimate is poorly understood and allows no flexibility for applications to the case where a potential is added to the Laplace operator. Very recent results have now resulted in positive and sharp estimates on the operator-plus-potential. However, the conditions required of the potential are too restrictive to include physically significant examples. This work will continue efforts to determine the full set of potentials for which the estimates actually hold. A second line of investigation concerns the Euler equation for an inviscid and incompressible fluid flow. When incompressible fluid flow occurs with a high Reynolds number (a measure of viscous resistance) in 3-dimensions, singularities form in finite time. However, this has only been demonstrated numerically. Because the singularities can only occur if the vorticity is stretched, numerical approximation of solutions which form singularities is very subtle. In this project a rigorous study of some prototype models with exact solutions will be made. These will then be used to check numerical methods and possibly design new ones if the available ones are not sensitive enough. The third problem area concerns operators arising in the study of partial differential equations with rough coefficients. The focus is on a question which has become known as the square- root Kato conjecture. It concerns the natural domain of the square-root of a divergence type second order differential operator. This domain is believed to be a specific Sobolev space of functions. A discovery by A. McIntosh led to a deep connection between the identification of this domain and the boundedness of Cauchy-kernal operators on Lipschitz curves, a problem of considerable interest, which harmonic analysts have been studying for nearly two decades. Recent work suggests that a resolution of the conjecture may be at hand - at least in spaces of dimension less than five. Work will continue toward this goal.\n",

This work will allow us to better understand the underlying principles of the structure and dynamics of condensed matter. This project focuses on several topics of current interest e.g. the mechanism of alkyl chain motion in channel clathrates,in layered intercalation compounds and alkylated clusters; the effects of specific interactions such as hydrogen bonding on internal rotations in molecular crystals; and the molecular reorientation in liquid crystals. Advantage will be taken of recently developed techniques for comparing the individual spectral densities of motion obtained from experiments with those obtained from molecular dynamics calculations. Particular advantage will be taken of a new magnetic resonance technique developed by the Volds called frequency stepping in order to greatly reduce the usual line broadening problems associated with isotopes whose nuclear spin average is greater than one half.\n",
      "a9000429 ANI $1 Argonne National Laboratory along with the University of Chicago, the University of Illinois at Chicago, Northwestern University, and Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory propose that an NSFNET NSS be located at the Argonne main facility in Chicago. The Argonne National Laboratory is a large, multiprogram facility owned by the U.S. Government and operated by the University of Chicago under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy. This proposal will provide a major access point to NSFNET, to CICnet, and to the National Research and Education Network. It will provide access to national resources by the academic, government, and industrial research enterprises in the Chicago area and provide access to major research resources located in the area by scientists throughout the nation. These resources will be made even more accessible by establishing an interagency gateway at Argonne between NSFNET, ESnet, MILNET, and the NASA Science Network. Furthermore, Argonne and its four partners in this proposal are committed to provide whatever support may be needed to ensure the success of the node in providing excellent NSFNET access service in the Chicago area for inbound and outbound network traffic.***\n",
      "a9000430 ATM $57669 The high latitude plasma structure campaigns (HLPS) are aimed at the understanding of the general morphology of ionization structures that are observed in the high latitude polar cap thermosphere. Many of the different phenomena that are studied are solar cycle dependent with some of the key processes apparent only at solar maximum. Since the next few years are at the peak of one of the largest solar activity cycles a unique opportunity exists to study these phenomena with extensive coordinated observations at many different polar locations with many different diagnostic instruments. This proposed project will enable scientists to take full advantage of two recently installed modern digital ionosondes (Digisonde) at two remote locations in Greenland during HLPS campaigns in 1990 and 1991.\n",
      "a9000433 OCE $173865 Dipping reflectors within the oceanic crust have been observed in marine multichannel seismic data from several different areas. These reflectors are frequently confined to the lower crust and either die out in the mid-crust or flatten out and merge with strong sub-horizontal upper crustal reflectors. A small number of obrserved reflectors cut through the entire crustal section. The geological significance of of these intra-crustal dipping reflectors is still poorly understood. They have been interpreted as normal faults, primary magmatic layering in the lower crust, or low-angle thrust faults. This project will do additional processing and interpretation on data sets from three areas in the Atlantic Ocean; the Blake-Spur fracture zone, the MARK area south of the Kane fracture zone, and the Canary basin.\n",
      "a9000434 OCE $344412 High rates of sedimentation and common planktonic and benthic foraminifera make the far northwest Pacific Ocean ideal for studying the details for glacial-interglacial climate and change. A transect of large-diameter piston and gravity cores collected from between 2300 and 4000 m water depth on Meiji Drift (NW Pacific) will be used to make the first hydrographic reconstructions of a small area in the Pacific Ocean. Defining late Quaternary hydrographic change in the North Pacific is important because it is the \"end member\" of modern deep circulation, but limited geochemical evidence suggests that it may not have been so during glaciation. Stable isotopes and radiocarbon in foraminifera and sediment chemistry will be used to test for evidence of young (nutrient.depleted) deep water, young intermediate water, and changes in ocean ventilation, in salinity, fertility, and in the corrosiveness of bottom waters in the glacial ocean. Results from this project will be useful for comparing with similar efforts in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans in order to understand the role of the ocean in climate change.\n",
      "a9000435 OCE $52147 Detailed surveys of a propagating spreading center along the East Pacific Rise (EPR) at 95.5W show that plate boundary configurations, rather than being static, can undergo complex geometric changes. Models based on either dynamic, kinematic or mechanical processes within the crust and mantle have been developed to explain these intricacies. However, the applicability of these models to other propagating systems has yet to be established, and Dr. Martinez will conduct an evaluation of the various models by examining previously acquired data from the Pito Deep area at 23S on the EPR. This area contrasts with the 95.5 propagator in severval ways: the Pito Deep propagator is advancing along a broad \"front\", not a \"tip\" as at 95.5N; local topography varies enormously from a regional mean of 3500m to a local depression of 5980m; and complex topography north of the rift mimics the fabric and trend of the rift zone, suggesting an unusually strong coupling across this region. Any or all of these constrasts may be explained by the fact that Pito Deep is offset along a long (300 km vs 30 km for the feature at 95.5N) transform and intrudes into unusually old lithosphere (3 my vs 1 my). Dr. Martinez will grid existing SeaMARCII bathymetry and construct a terrain-corrected Bouger anomaly map of the Pito Deep region. With this and with assumptions of the nature of isostatic compensation he will calculate residual gravity anomalies to identify anomalies due to Moho topography. Anomalies that remain after this procedure will form the basis for testing among the competing models that require either: 1) viscous flow in the asthenosphere, 2) thermal effects due to dike intrusion, or 3) mechanical implications of a lithosphere of finite strength.\n",

      "a9000442 OCE $56451 Drill core samples from ODP Leg 115 demonstrate that aragonite cycles on the Maldives platform mimic changes in oxygen isotope values, and as found elsewhere, probably result from changes in dissolution and detrital input. Furthermore, reconnaisance surveys have revealed that, in contrast to their asymmetry in the Bahamas, prograding clinoforms in the Maldive lagoons respond to the bi-directional, seasonal Asian monsoon. Dr. Droxler has been awarded funds to participate on an international expedition to this area aboard the French vessel Marion Dufresne. Giant piston cores (up to 40 m long), water samples and high resolution echosounding and seismic profiles will be collected. Back in Texas, Dr. Droxler and assistants will conduct preliminary studies including: 1) sedimentologic and isotopic analyses of selected core samples; 2) chemical analyses of hydrocast samples; and 3) processing and interpretation of 1200-1500 km of SCS data. These latter data will be integrated with multichannel seismic reflection data collected in the 1970's by Elf Aquataine and made available to Dr. Droxler by his French colleagues. His research goals are to: 1) match carbonate mineralogy to observed water chemistry; 2) map thicknesses of Holocene sediments to guage offbank transport; 3) measure Pleistocene aragonite cycles and match them to known patterns of platform diagenesis; and 4) determine the response to Pleistocene sea-level changes.\n",

      "a9000450 OCE $385094 This project aims at gaining an understanding of the geochemical behavior and distribution of isotopes of beryllium (10 Be, 9Be, and 7Be) and aluminum (26Al and 27Al) in the ocean-atmospheric system. Such an understanding will provide insight for use of these isotopes as time and process tracers for a number of oceanographic and geophysical problems such as marine geochronology, ocean mixing, particulate-trace element interaction, variation of cosmic-ray and geomagnetic field intensity, paleo-intensity of dust transport to the ocean, and aerosol behavior. Work in progress includes studies of Be isotopes in aerosols and rain, in ocean water and its particulate matter, and in sediment pore fluid. Work is continuing in determining the distribution and degree of isotopic homogenization of 10Be/9Be in the deep ocean, in evaluating the 7Be/10Be geochronometry. Continuing efforts will be directed toward the finalization/summarization of results for publication. An expedition will be conducted to the Central Pacific to study the 26Al/10Be and 7Be systematics in the ocean. This will represent the first attempt to measure cosmogenic 26Al in sea water. It is anticipated that the results of the study will further enhance our ability to utilize cosmogenic nuclides 26Al, 10Be and 7Be for geophysical and oceanographic applications.\n",

      "a9000457 SES $1000 This dissertation will investigate information-seeking behavior by newcomers to organizations. Five primary tasks must be accomplished before a newcomer can become an insider--task mastery, role clarification, acculturation, and social integration. Information is essential for accomplishing these tasks. It is argued that newcomers who initiate the exchange of information will adjust more rapidly and more effectively than those who passively wait for information to be delivered. In this study, 250 newly hired auditors in five large accounting firms will complete written surveys assessing information seeking and various facets of socialization at three time points. The results will contribute to understanding the newcomer in socialization processes. Socialization research has traditionally focused on organizational activities, and newcomers have been portryed as fairly passive recipients of organizations' influence. This dissertation will make an important theoretical contribution by focusing on the role of information, and information transmission, in the socialization process. Further, it will enhance our understanding of information seeking, particularly the different forms of seeking and the implications that this activity has for the seeker.\n",
      "a9000458 OCE $75021 In January 1988 a seismic tomography experiment was carried out on the East Pacific Rise at 9 degrees 30'N to image in three- dimensions the seismic velocity structure of the rise axis. This experiment yielded a seismic data set consisting of more that 8000 records from approximately 500 shots and 15 ocean bottom seismometers. Initial results from the tomographic inversion of P wave delay times indicate substantial heterogeneity in structure both across and along the rise axis; for instance, the axial low velocity anomaly at 2 km depth is 1.5km/s slower than off axis; the along-axis variations in this velocity anomaly exceed 20%. This renewal will continue the investigation of seismic velocity models using improved inversion techniques, will explore methods of utilizing waveform amplitude information to constrain further the 3-D seismic structure, and will analyze and interpret the gravity, magnetic, and microearthquake data obtained during the course of the tomography experiment.\n",

      "a9000460 ANI $10001 The Office of Network Technologies at the Georgia Institute of Technology proposes the installation and operation NSFSNET Node at Georgia Tech. The Office of Network Technologies has significant expertise in the management and operation of large scale multi-access networks utilizing the TCP/IP protocol suite. SURAnet, which spans 13 states, has more nodes than any of the other mid-level networks. Partially because it has only 1 NSS it suffers serious \"hopcount\" problems. It has congestion problems as well. Because of it's location and it's proximity to telecommunications Points Of Presence (POP's), Georgia Tech strategically positioned to provide a second SURAnet NSS. Locating a second SURAnet NSS at Georgia Tech would allow SURAnet to significantly reduce hopcounts between SURAnet nodes and would almost double the bandwidth out of SURAnet into the Internet. SURAnet supports several T1 lines between Georgia Tech and other SURAnet nodes. In the event of a failure at the University of Maryland, the Georgia Tech site could provide enough redundancy to temporarily service all SURAnet traffic. Load balancing between the two NSS's can be accomplished by adjusting routing metrics. SURAnet and Georgia Tech has developed satisfactory procedures to insure coordination between the nodes at the University of Maryland and Georgia Tech.***//\n",
      "a9000463 OCE $709853 The Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium will operate the research vessel PELICAN, a 105' general oceanographic vessel constructed in 1985 and the R/V ACADIANA, a 57' research vessel constructed in 1986. Both ships will operate in the Mississippi River and delta region. The R/V PELICAN will also operate in the Gulf of Mexico. These vessels are part of a fleet used by the National Science Foundation to support oceanographic research projects. Most oceanographic research projects require highly specialized equipment and extensive support from a ship's crew members. An increasing number of research projects require equipment that must be permanently installed on a ship and for which the ship must be specifically designed. Such equipment also requires highly trained crew members for maintenance and operation. These vessels do not operate in the same manner as general cargo or fishing vessels, and therefore, NSF supports the operation of a variety of vessels specifically dedicated to oceanographic research. These vessels are operated by universities and research institutions around the country.\n",

All of the cored sediments are less than 120,000 years old and have sedimentation rates of at least 10 cm/kyr during the Holocene and 30 cm/kyr or higher during the Pleistocene. The results will provide new information about the long term behavior of the earth's magnetic field and an improved relative chronostratigraphy for related paleoceanographic studies that are also being done on these cores. The proposed work will include detailed rock magnetic studies of these cores to estimate grain size changes, diagenetic influences, and magnetic fabric variations that may have paleoceanographic implications.\n",

The main problem is to determine the intrinsic geometric nature of these cohomology theories; this appears to be very difficult, and at present a number of leads that appear promising are being explored. A prominent role in this study is played by the formal groups of Jacobi quartics and the Legendre polynomials which enter as coefficients of the invariant differential.

      "a9000474 SES $21400 This project addresses causes of urban homicide rates. The PI will draw hypotheses from four competing theoretical perspec- tives: (1) Subculture of violence, the idea that areas with high homicide rates are characterized by a higher expected (or tolera- ted) level of violence; (2) Socioeconomic, the idea that violence is a consequence of material deprivation, such as homicides connected with robbery; (3) Punishment and deterrence, the idea that homicide rates rise and fall with changes in certainty and severity of punishment; (4) Life patterns, a more complex idea involving motivation, opportunities, and lack of effective guardians such as police. Each theory has strong proponents, but data seldom have been applied to compare the predictive success of each. Part of the reason for the lack of empirical verifica- tion has been the difficulty of obtaining longitudinal data. This project uses matched areas, with a 30-year time span, to estimate a model incorporating hypotheses from all four theories. The results should permit assessment of contribution of the factors specified in each theory, and understanding conditions under which each theoretical process is most likely to appear.\n",

      "a9000483 OCE $200000 The overall goal of this research is to determine quantitatively, the interactive regulatory factors and underlying mechanisms of predator-prey dynamics in a marine soft-bottom community. The researchers have extensive background knowledge as well as an innovative ultrasonic biotelemetry techniques to examine the predator-prey complex in a small sub-estuary (the Rhode River) of Chesapeake Bay. The researchers will measure the components of predator behavior which lead to changes in the functional and aggregative responses. The predator-prey complex includes large blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) which feed on two common species of infaunal clams (Macoma balthica and Mya arenaria) as well as cannibalizing small blue crabs. Demersal fish are also abundant predators which feed extensively on clam siphons and other benthic invertebrates which live in the sediments, but not on large whole clams. Earlier work focused on the interactive effects of prey species, sediment type, and prey density on the persistence of prey encountering intense predation, with emphasis on the functional response of blue crabs foraging on clams. Biotelemetry has been used to determine the scales of variation in predator behavior and movement between key prey patches. Thus, these investigatins focus on the blue crab's aggregative response with prey patches, which links the regulatory factors, underlying mechanisms, and resulting dynamics of this predator-prey system. This research will: 1) determine the interactive factors (prey species, prey density, and predator density) regulating the aggregative response of the main predator (large blue crabs); 2) determine the interactive factors (density and distribution of prey, habitat refugia, and predator density) regulating predation rates upon two alternate prey (clams and small crabs); and 3) investigate the behavioral/physiological mechanisms of large blue crabs aggregating in prey patches and switching between small crabs and clams.\n",
      "a9000486 DEB $240375 Habitat destruction and fragmentation in tropical forests are the single largest threat to the planet's biodiversity. The roles of genetic and demographic factors in the extinction of small populations in fragmented habitat patches are understood in theory but poorly documented empirically. To test existing theory and to improve techniques of biodiversity conservation, the investigators will develop a new method of monitoring population viability in recently fragmented populations. Specifically, they will conduct population viability analyses of rat, tree shrew, and other small mammal populations in small rainforest patches of different sizes during the first six years following isolation. These habitat patches were all isolated in 1987 when the creation of the Chiew Larn reservoir flooded a forested valley in the Khlong Saeng Wildlife Sanctuary, Thailand, and created 165 islands. Demographic changes in selected populations will be monitored by seasonal live-trapping as will levels of genetic variation, inbreeding and gene flow. The study is novel in that the genetic changes will be monitored at the DNA sequence level with DNA obtained non-invasively from plucked hair. This study will contribute to our basic understanding of evolutionary biology and ecology in a number of ways. It will provide among the first sequence-level data on variation in a number of nuclear and mitochondrial genes in several free- ranging mammal species. It will also provide one of the first cases where both genetic and ecological aspects of population viability are monitored in the critical first 20 generations following insularization. In addition, the study promises to contribute to conservation biology in three significant ways. First, the development of the genetic monitoring technique based on non-invasive sampling of DNA from hair will have wide applicability. Second, the demonstration that population viability can be monitored in common small mammals should lead to improved management practices for rarer and more endangered species. Finally, the lessons learned from this study in Thai forest fragments should be applicable to biodiversity conservation elsewhere in the tropics.\n",
      "a9000489 MCB $5000 The International Conferences on Magnetic Resonance in Biological Systems has been held every two years since 1964. Over the years, these conferences have played an extremely important role in promoting the development and application of a variety of magnetic resonance techniques to the solution of biological problems, and are clearly recognized as the premier international meetings in this important field. The XIVth meeting will be held in England in September, 1990. It will cover the latest advances in the fields of NMR and ESR including (1) protein and peptide structure and dynamics; (2) 3D structure from 2D NMR; (3) metalloprotein and electron transfer; (4) biological membranes and (5) magnetic resonance imaging.\n",

The drifters will provide data on surface and subsurface temperature and surface currents. Scientific goals are to map Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and currents, understand processes responsible for annual and interannual variability in SST, and improve operational Pacific Ocean models.\n",
      "a9000501 INT $10000 This award will support Professor Mario Gerla of the University of California at Los Angeles in a research collaboration with Professor Luigi Fratta of the Politechnical University, Milan, Italy. The proposers intend to focus on the design of high speed networks. The advances in fiber optics, signal processing and switching technologies, the proliferation of microcomputers and workstations and the increasing sophistica- tion of the end user offer new opportunities for the introduction of enhanced communications services to business and residences. The following main directions of research are proposed: design and evaluation of Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) architectures; performance evaluation and topology configuration of Broadband ISDNs; interconnection of LANs, MANs and B-ISDNs. Novel metropolitan network architectures based on tree topologies and wavelength division multiplexing will be investigated, with the goal of achieving much higher speeds (in the Gigabit range) than available from existing MAN products. Network control and management techniques for high speed, wide area networks will be developed to guarantee efficiency and to prevent congestion.\n",
      "a9000502 OCE $82202 The School of Oceanography at University of Washington will acquire components for a modern six-channel autoanalyzer that will be placed in a pool of shared use equipment. This equipment is maintained for use on or in association with research vessels operated by the University. The instrument- ation will also increase the capabilities of the ship and of the institution to support research and engineering activities. This new device will replace existing and outmoded equipment that is no longer serviceable and will be operated as a shared use facility. The instrument provides rapid and accurate measurements of several nutrients and chemical constituents in seawater samples. Such measurements are important in modern oceanographic and marine biological investigations.

      "a9000503 CHE $421000 Professor Weisshaar is supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program for investigations of the spectroscopy and dynamics of small gas phase species containing transition metal atoms. Little is currently known experimentally about the electronic structure of such molecules, nor is there much existing information on how reactant electronic structure controls chemical reactivity in simple transition metal systems. Laser vaporization of metal targets permits the formation of molecular beams for the study of the chemistry of gas phase metal species without the complications of attached solvent molecules. Resonantly-enhanced two photon ionization is used to investigate the spectroscopy and structure of transition metal dimers, trimers, oxides, and ligated atoms. These same techniques are used to prepare transition metal ions and characterize the resulting internal state distributions for subsequent dynamical studies as a function of initial ion internal state. Other dynamical studies include investigations of dissociative autoionization in metal dimers and time-resolved probing of molecules absorbed on small metal clusters.\n",
      "a9000507 IIS $60000 This research focuses on two main themes: (i) the unification of image segmentation methods in a framework based on scale space an differential equations, and (ii) the texture segmentation using Gabor filters and energy functions with discontinuities. It is intended that the resulting techniques will utimately be suitable for VLSI implementation. The goal of (i) is to provide a mathematical framework within which many current approaches to image segmenttion can be compared. The goal of (ii) is to devslop a model for texture segmentation using the energy function approach with Gabor filters. Interactions between filters will allow the system to deal with slowly varying changes in the orientation of textures, such as ocur in foreshortening.\n",
      "a9000511 INT $19000 This award will support Professor Lanny D. Schmidt of the University of Minnesota in a research collaboration with Professor Miguel Jose Yacaman of the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM) in Mexico City, Mexico. The researchers intend to establish on a more formal basis an ongoing program on heterogeneous catalysis. In particular, they plan to prepare catalysts, characterize their reactivity in different atmospheres, and determine how micro- structure affects reactivity. Attention will be directed at Rh-Ce catalyst particles in the NO+CO reaction and Pt-Sn particles in hydrocarbon hydrogenolysis and isomerization. These systems are used as automotive pollution catalysts and petroleum refining catalysts, respectively and are therefore of great importance to both the U.S. and Mexico. This award will help to promote the exchange of students, senior personnel, catalyst samples, and TEM micrographics between both institutions. The group at the University of Minnesota has been primarily interested in the relation of structure and reactivity while the UNAM group will contribute their expertise in micro-structure characterization.\n",
      "a9000517 OCE $216050 Long-chain alkenones are now widely recognized as promising for the assessment of paleotemperature and to some extent paleoproductivity in surface waters of the ocean. Ourability to interpret accurately the complete paleoceanographic implications of stratigraphic records for the alkenones inmarine sediment cores is currently limited by an ignorance of the ecology of the phytoplankton species that produce these biomarkers and of the ecology of the phytoplankton species that produce these biomarkers and of the processes responsible for their preservation in the sedimentary record. This research will advance our ability to extract realistice paleoceanographic information from the sedimentary record for the alkenonoes. The project willintegrate results from analyses of laboratory phytoplankton cultures and particulate samples from the field. The field samples include select sets of suspended particulate materials collected from ocean surface waters, vertically transported particulate materials collected in time series by sediment traps and underlying sediments collected by coring at three locations along an east-west transect off northern California. The two major goals of the proposed work are to clarify 1) where alkenone-producing phytoplankton reside withing the euphotic zone as a function of season, when these organisms are productive during the year and what surface water temperature is recorded by alkenone unsaturation patterns measured in underlying sediments as a consequence of these factors and 2) how the downcore record for alkenone concentration relates torelative changes in prymnesiophyte productivity and perhaps total primary productivity in overlying waters with time.\n",

The purpose of the conference is to bring together a group of mathematicians with strong affinities to both probability and mathematical theories related to physics. The topics of the conference are rigorous renormalization ideas, including self avoiding random walk and percolation, as well as ideas in functional integration, random fields, and stochastic geometry.\n",
      "a9000522 DMS $38015 The principal investigator will develop statistical theory and methods for categorical time series. Categorical time series arise in many scientific and engineering settings in which the observations can be classified by category (e.g. on or off) and not necessarily by a numerical scale. The principal investigator will employ the method of the Walsh-Fourier transform to investigate these time series. Specifically, the investigator will establish a broad theoretical basis for the application of Walsh-Fourier representation for real time stationary processes. Furthermore, he will develop sound methodologies for the scaling of categorical time series via the Walsh-Fourier transform. Scaling would allow the quantification of the categories and analysis of the data based on both time and frequency domain techniques.\n",
      "a9000526 CCR $54975 This project addresses a number of open questions concerning the accurate solution of least squares and eigenvalue problems. These two problem areas are interrelated, but there are separate issues for each one of them. For the work on least squares problems, there remain important issues in both the analysis and implementation of the algorithms. Both direct and iterative methods for the solution of equality constrained least squares problems will be considered. The work on direct methods concerns error analysis and implementation issues for sparse problems and for message passing architectures. The effort on iterative methods concerns the development of a class of preconditioners that would work well on constrained least squares problems. The investigation of the eigenvalue problems is based upon theoretical questions. Recently perturbation bounds on the relative errors in the eigenvalues of a certain class of symmetric diagonally dominant matrices have been developed. It has been shown that some algorithms achieve these bounds. For one important class of algorithms, divide-and-conquer algorithms, it is not known whether the relative error bounds can be achieved. Since this class of algorithms has shown good performance on several distributed memory architectures, the resolution of this open question will have a significant impact on how eigenvalue problems are solved.\n",

His work in compliant motion planning will emphasize handling of uncertainty and errors in sensing, real-time control, and the modeling of parts. Algorithms will be tested on an experimental, force-controlled assembly system using the Cornell robot arm. The ultimate goal is to permit high-level specification of force-controlled assembly tasks, without requiring humans to specify the required forces and sensing strategies.\n",
      "a9000536 OCE $139557 The Principal Investigator will investigate the absence of deformation on the Magdelena fan, located on the northern Colombian convergent margin, using GLORIA images and single-channel seismic data collected in the summer of 1989 on the RRS Charles Darwin. Two competing models have been proposed to explain the lack of shortening on the fan. One proposes that the low surface slope of the fan suppresses deformation; thus sedimentation rates would alter the geometry of compressional deformation. In the other model, block tectonics in northern South America creates different amounts of convergence along the various blocks. If the block-boundary faults continue offshore across the active accretinary wedge then the amount of convergence should change across block boundaries. These models will be tested by determining the geometry, and rates and timing of the deformation near the edges of the fan.\n",

This conference is scheduled to be held June 17-22, 1990 at the Vermont Academy in Saxton's River, VT. The field of retinoid research has expanded in the last decade to include scientists from diverse areas. The major goal of this conference is to provide a common forum to scientists from different countries and backgrounds to learn about the latest developments in retinoid research and share their ideas with colleagues. This is particularly important for junior researchers who are finding productive and stimulating environments for their future endeavors. The conference will provide a poster discussion session to maximize active participation by junior researchers. Research on retinoids is important for understanding cell communication, development and differentiation, phototransduction in vision, and regulation of gene expression. This conference will provide the opportunity for researchers working in these diverse areas to discuss their common concerns and develop new approaches that will increase basic knowledge of the function of these important biological molecules.\n",
      "a9000538 DMS $21700 This award supports the research in Lie groups and Lie algebras of Professor Ronald Irving of the University of Washington. Dr. Irving's project is to study certain algebraic topics underlying recent work in the representation theory of complex semisimple Lie algebras and real reductive Lie groups. Many important representations in Lie theory have finite length and lie in categories of finite length modules. These categories carry a great deal of additional algebraic structure, such as translation functors or a filtered character theory. Professor Irving will study these features and their consequences in greater detail. Any time there are operations that may be undone as well as done, there is a group present. Groups were first studied systematically in the last century, and when the Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie showed that group theory applied in a very natural way to the study of differential equations, the strength and significance of group theory became recognized by all mathematicians. The work supported here is a modern continuation of that first pioneering work of Lie.\n",
      "a9000541 CMS $0 This research addresses the design and control of machines that will have stable dynamic interaction with humans via simultaneous exchange of both power and information signals. Typically, human interaction with machines involves an exchange of information signals only, i.e., pushing the start button on and activating an electric mixer, but not transferring power directly to the mixer, or feeling the load on the mixer blades. Orthoses, devices attached directly to a human for the purpose of performing a task or aiding a handicapped individual, are examples of machines which do involve the exchange of power and information between human and machine. This research is a five phase activity which focuses on (1) development of a learning controller for on line computer modeling of human hand dynamic behavior, (2) development of the rules for the design of a supervisor controller to create a particular behavior that humans cannot perform unaided, (3) study of the design of a multi degree of freedom orthosis that can exchange power and information signals with humans, (4) design and fabrication of a prototype orthosis and computing environment, and (5) experimental evaluation of the performance of this system. The ultimate objective is a prototype orthosis which transfers to the human's hand, in feedback fashion, a scaled down version of the actual external load which the orthosis is manipulating. This natural feedback force on the human's hand lets her feel a modified version of the external forces on the orthosis.\n",
      "a9000544 DMS $36226 Professor Siedentop will investigate the mathematical physics of Coulomb systems. The proposed work concerns (i) the asymptotic behavior of the ground state energy and its leading corrections for large molecules; (ii) the ground state density near the Coulomb singularities of the nuclei; and (iii) bounds on the excess charge and ionization energy for various models of atomic and molecular systems. The proposed work involves developing approximate methods of calculating various quantities associated with the atomic physics of large atoms and molecules. The systems in question are described by the Schrodinger equation, a partial differential equation which in the cases at hand involves many variables. It is thus too difficult to solve explicitly, and approximation techniques must be developed to understand these systems. Professor Siedentop's research will contribute to this important field in an area of interest to both mathematicians and physicists.\n",

In the course of this work, he has been able to identify some systems which are particularly \"clean\" and he proposes to use these special geometries to answer some current open questions in l.t. condensed-matter physics. Specifically, he proposes to study: - 1) scaling and dimensional cross-over for 4He using a glass capillary array; 2) the difference between local and non-local non-linear interactions in random systems and quasiperiodic systems; 3) 2D, strong, Anderson localization as a function of the amount of disorder; and 4) the superfluid transition with 4He permeated by a variable weak-link array (generated with standing e.m. waves from crossed laser beams), with the possibility of observing a controlled Bose glass transition.\n",

The main thrust of this research will be on quasi-3 dimensional (Q3D) electron gas based on wide parabolic well structures grown epitaxially with gallium-aluminum arsenide heterostructures. The research involves the study of Q3D magneto-plasmons in these systems with the ultimate goal being the discovery of the Wigner crystal. The plans also include the study of magneto-plasmons in the two-dimensional electron gas system because of magneto-rotons associated with the fractional quantum Hall effect. The equilibrium properties of the upper Hubbard band for silicon in doped gallium arsenide will also be studied, as will impurity band formation in two-dimensional delta-doped gallium arsenide.\n",
      "a9000556 MCB $470431 The goal of this research is to gain insight into the process of starvation-induced growth arrest in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Although growth arrest is a universal response to starvation, the process by which it occurs and the relationship between growth arrest and the characteristic physiological changes associated with the arrest are not well understood. Recently several genes have been identified whose transcripts exhibit distinct patterns of accumulation as cells undergo starvation-induced arrest. The accumulation of these transcripts in arrest-defective mutants will be studied to determine the time at which the mutants stop development and, thus, to map control points during arrest. The promoter of one gene whose arrest- specific transcript accumulation is cAMP-mediated will be fused to a selectable marker gene to isolate regulatory mutants. Mutants obtained by this selection will be analyzed to determine whether similarly-regulated genes are essential, whether their expression is sufficient to induce arrest, and whether cAMP is directly involved in this regulation. Nutrient limitation is one of the most common stresses affecting cell viability and growth. Because of this, there is great selective pressure for cells to sense, respond to, and survive prolonged periods of starvation. When faced with nutrient limitations, yeast, like many other organisms, ceases dividing and undergoes a series of characteristic morphological, biochemical, and physiological changes. The proposed research will provide insight into the mechanism of starvation induced growth arrest by characterizing some of the genes whose expression is altered during nutrient limitation. Because starvation is a universal stress, understanding the general mechanisms by which simple eucaryotic organisms, like yeast, respond to and survive starvation may well provide insight into these mechanisms in higher organisms.\n",
      "a9000558 DMI $30000 Manufacturers of discrete products have not yet made full use of the power of the computer to improve their performance. In particular, most manufacturers use linear process plans that are based upon the planner's estimate of which machine will be \"the best\" at the time when the work pieces are produced. This imposes unnecessary constraints on the process plan and the machine type choice is made without current knowledge of the system's status. Both have the potential to reduce the system efficiency/effectiveness by restricting the system manager's domain of alternatives for dispatching and processing the workload (scheduling and control). The long term goal of Technology Constrained Process Planning (TCOPP) is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of discrete manufacturing through improved processing planning, scheduling, and control. This will be accomplished through 1) the specification of process plans as directed graphs, based upon technological constraints; and 2) functional specification of the process plan, rather than a specific class of work station. The result will be an increase in the degrees of freedom available for scheduling and controlling the production of the workload. Resource assignments will be based upon current system status. The expanded domain of alternatives and use of current system status can reasonably be expected to improve decision making and system efficiency/effectiveness.\n",

      "a9000567 DMS $49200 This award supports the research on level structures for Abelian varieties of Professor Peter Norman of the University of Massachusetts. Dr. Norman's work will involve the problems of lifting Abelian varieties from positive characteristic to zero characteristic, as well as researches on Hilbert-Blumenthal varieties and Dieudonne theory. This is research in the field of arithmetic algebraic geometry, a subject that combines the techniques of algebraic geometry and number theory. In its original formulation, algebraic geometry treated figures that could be defined in the plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Number theory started with the whole numbers and such questions as divisibility of one whole number by another. These two subjects, seemingly so far apart, have in fact influenced each other from the earliest times, but in the past quarter century the mutual influence has increased greatly. The field of arithmetic algebraic geometry now uses techniques from all of modern mathematics, and is having corresponding influence beyond its own borders.\n",

Additionally he will investigate chaotic and stable behavior of almost periodic trajectories. The starting point for these studies will be normal form theory for the Lagrange equilibrium point of the three body problem. Roughly between the Earth and the Moon lies two so called Lagrange points. These are stable points where it is believed bits of matter have accumulated. The investigator will search for other such points as well as for chaotic trajectories. Information concerning these locations in space should prove valuable to human exploration of the Moon and planets.\n",
      "a9000571 ECS $238961 Image formation in and through irregular media, ranging from atmospheric inhomogeneities to the very difficult case of diffusely scattering media such as human tissue, remains a major challenge of image science. The range of technology that has been brought to bear on these problems is considerable, including active adaptive optics, image deconvolution, phase retrieval and phase conjugation. The present work proposes various ideas for imaging through inhomogeneities and for imaging objects embedded within inhomogeneities. The first category, imaging through inhomogeneities, embodies extensions of a technique recently developed by the principal investigator for imaging through inhomogeneities using a superresolution technique. The goal is to extend this capability in various ways, in particular, to eliminate the need for an aberration- free path from source to the mixer, which can be accomplished by combining spatial and temporal encoding techniques. The second category is the imaging of objects embedded within the inhomogeneity. Several techniques are proposed, such as confocal scanning with the use of extremely short pulses of light.\n",

      "a9000573 DMI $234250 This research addresses two discrete problems that have arisen in the automated machinery that performs the die and wire bonding operations in microelectronic manufacturing with very high throughput. The problems in machine design are a result of inadequate fundamental understanding of problems in heat transfer and metal to metal and metal to semiconductor bonding partly due to diffusion at the material interface.

      "a9000574 CTS $153211 The regenerative engine is a new concept of internal combustion engine in which part of the energy of the exhaust gases is recovered in a porous regenerator to be used in the next cycle. As a result, the thermodynamic cycle in the engine is radically changed. A computational model, including fluid friction as well as thermodynamic variables, has shown indicated efficiencies in excess of 40 percent for wide ranges of fuel/air mixture ratios, speeds, loads, and design parameters. This engine also promises a reduction of pollutant emissions and a higher power density through the elimination of knock. It is proposed to test experimentally this cycle in order to check the appropriateness of the model and the practical potential of the new cycle. Conventional engine tests (load, speed, fuel consumption, and emissions) will be performed over a prototype engine composed of two single-cylinder engines. In this engine, one cylinder acts as a compressor and the other as an expander with a variable phase difference between them. Flow is controlled by a series of poppet valves. Experimental indicated cycles will be obtained for comparison with the predictions of the model and its further improvement. Heat transfer and combustion sub-models will be added as experimental data become available.\n",

The emphasis will be on infinite particle systems that model non- equilibrium processes. The questions investigated will be concerned primarily with the rate at which the processes converge to their equilibrium. The investigator will study some fundamental questions about the relationships between several notions of convergence to equilibrium for stochastic Ising models. He will also consider relationships between rates of convergence and properties of the equilibrium measures. The principal investigator will undertake new work on the rate of evaporation for a stochastic model of an evaporating droplet.\n",
      "a9000582 DMS $56100 Symmetry plays an important role in mathematics, physics, and other sciences. In mathematics, symmetry has many different but related manifestations. A finite group G of symmetries of a space X induces symmetries on algebraic invariants of X. In this way, transformation groups and representation theory become intimately related. In this project, the investigator will look systematically at the interaction between the geometry of the symmetry (e.g., fixed points, stability subgroups, etc.) and the algebraic invariants of such representations. In particular, symmetries of Moore spaces (the Steenrod Problem posed in early 1960's) and algebraic curves and surfaces arising in algebraic geometry and number theory (besides topology) provide concrete problems to which the following general theory will apply. A significant feature of this project is its interdisciplinary nature, which requires tools and ideas from several branches of mathematics. This provides a natural setting for interaction of these areas, including new applications of algebraic geometry to transformation groups and modular representation theory. Other applications include (algorithmic and inductive) construction of important classes of modular representations, number theoretic properties of algebraic function fields, and a deeper understanding of symmetries of algebraic surfaces versus 4- dimensional manifolds. A long term objective is solution of the long-standing Steenrod Problem and its application to the problem of existence of symmetry for manifolds.\n",

The principal investigator will also pursue the Waring problem and other problems of additive number theory for various rings including polynomial and matrix rings. In addition, he will study systems of linear partial differential equations from the algebraic point of view. This research is in the general area of algebraic K-theory. It is concerned with a wide variety of qualitative and quantitative problems related to subgroups of algebraic groups.\n",
      "a9000588 DMS $180728 This project will study propagation of waves in one, two, and three dimensional excitable media, with emphasis on the cardiac conduction system and Belousov-Zhabotinski reagent. The emphasis of the study is on understanding the dynamics of spatial patterns, especially the formation and evolution of spiral and scroll waves. The study will involve the construction of mathematical models describing the dynamics of patterns of propagating waves, the mathematical analysis of the model equations, and the comparison of the mathematical results with available experimental evidence.\n",
      "a9000590 DMS $46823 The research will improve measurement science by developing new statistical calibration methodology for precision instruments. Calibration with errors in the standards will be examined through the errors-in-variables regression problem. Multivariate calibration problems in analytical chemistry will be studied through statistical models. New data analytic alternatives to hypothesis testing will be provided by combining parametric and nonparametric aspects in one model. This semiparametric approach will be used to estimate the percentage of contamination in a sample and provide asymptotic distributions.\n",
      "a9000593 DMS $18500 This project will study the general area of instability in various physical systems using advanced mathematical concepts from perturbation theory, dynamical systems theory and Hamiltonian mechanics. Among the topics to be considered are the stability of dispersive wave solutions of the Ginzburg-Landau equation and the Zakharov equation, the advective mixing of fluid trajectories at the onset of chaos in viscous flows and the escape of particle trajectories of rotating Hamiltonian systems from KAM regions. The phenomenon of turbulence is perhaps the most important and the most difficult problem in fluid dynamics today. In this project the principal investigator will study simple models of turbulent flows using techniques from perturbation theory and nonlinear mechanics in order to understand better how instabilities in flows are magnified to the point where the flows go completely unstable and become turbulent. This too is an important problem, predicting where and when a flow first becomes turbulent, since very often one wants to delay the onset of turbulence for as long as possible.\n",
      "a9000594 OCE $86700 This award supports a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site proposal to provide research experiences for selected undergraduates in marine sciences, to acquaint them with the excitement and opportunities of academic research and to encourage them to pursue graduates studies and a career in ocean sciences.\n",
      "a9000595 OCE $86550 The Australian-Antarctic Discordance (AAD) is the parsent-day manifestation, at a divergent plate boundary, of a region of low gravity and anomalously deep ocean floor between Australia and Antarctica. The AAD also contains the boundary between Pacific- type and Indian-type global-scale isotopic provinces. The spreading axis within the discordance displays an unusual, crenulate offset pattern and, at constant (medium) spreading rate, almost the full spectrum of axial ridge morphologies. Coupled with this morphologic and tectonic diversity is an unusually broad geochemical diversity that appears to require a broad range of primary magma compositions which require, in turn, a broad variation in conditions of melting. The principal investigator led a successful cruise to the area in 1988 and obtained 15 days of SeaMARC II side-scan coverage and 26 new dredge hauls. The objectives of this work are to: determine, in as fine detail as possible, the nature and location of the isotopic boundary; fully define the geochemical and petrologic diversity of AAD lavas and to understand the underlying petrogenetic causes for this diversity in relation to tectonics and MORB genesis in general; and define and evaluate the diversity of lavas along one section of the ridge in terms of distinctively different processes by which they evolved.\n",
      "a9000597 CCR $193498 The depth-first control behavior of most logic programming languages, such as Prolog, is powerful but inflexible. The language Conlog has been developed to investigate the use of first-class continuations to express a wide variety of control behavior in the context of logic programming. Conlog extends Prolog with extra-logical operators that allow alternate control behavior to be expressed, while retaining a default depth-first behavior. The low-level operators, which allow programmers to directly manipulate first-class continuations, may be used to implement high-level operators that abstract breadth-first search and multitasking. Research includes an implementation of Conlog, based on earlier work on logic state-spaces, and a denotational semantics of the low-level operators. In future work, operators for heuristic-based search and alternate approaches to synchronous and asynchronous multitasking will be investigated, a semantics expressive of \"phases\" of goal satisfaction will be developed, and current implementation techniques for efficient support of first-class continuations.\n",
      "a9000598 INT $24154 The United States and the Soviet Union are probably the two leading countries in both astrophysics and cosmology. Cooperative research in these areas, however, have not been common in the past. This workshop will provide an important opportunity to strongly stimulate long-term joint cooperation in an area of research which is of great interest to the world-wide scientific community. The thematic focus of the workshop, which is being organized by Dr. Adrian L. Melott of the University of Kansas and Dr. Sergey F. Shandarin of the Institute of Physical Problems of the U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences, is the legacy of Yakov B. Zel'dovich in Astrophysics and Cosmology. One of the most important figures in twentieth-century cosmology, Zel'dovich (who died in 1987) was responsible for fundamental advances in these areas that are being actively investigated today. The workshop will involve some 10 to 15 scientists from each country, including 5-10 young investigators from each side. The workshop will include an opening session on the future of cosmology, which will be open to the public and oriented to their understanding, as well as a three-day scientific program will consist of a series of brief presentations followed by extended discussion periods. Selected observers will be permitted to attend. Participants will be invited to use the final day for the development of collaborative relationships and preparation of specific proposals for long-term cooperative research for subsequent submission and competitive review. This project fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading researchers in the United States and the U.S.S.R. to combine complemen- tary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence in the field of basic scientific research on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.\n",
      "a9000603 OCE $189621 The oceanic crust has frequently been modeled as relatively uniform in thickness with a characteristic velocity structure composed of linear gradients that do not generate reflectors in vertical incidence seismic profiling. Recently, however, improved profiling techniques and data processing capabilities have revealed that the lower oceanic crust in some regions has a distinct suite of low-angle dipping reflectors. A few of these events cross the entire crustal section and may terminate at depth in the uppermost mantle. The distribution and origin of these events is critical to understanding the processes that form the oceanic crust and the subsequent development of the stress field in the oceanic plate. The present award will analyze previously collected data in the vicinity of ODP site 504B in the eastern equatorial Pacific. Future drilling is planned at this site to extend the hole into the lower crust. Analysis of the seismic reflection data will allow the drilling results to be placed in a proper regional context and should provide constraints on the nature of the crust producing the reflectors. The project represents the first research support to Dr. Zehnder who has recently completed her doctoral research on the deep crustal structure in the North Atlantic.\n",
      "a9000605 OPP $186177 The large size and rapid growth of kelp is due, at least in part, to their ability to optimize growth under a variety of light conditions through changes in photosynthetic performance. This feature may be most pronounce in one arctic species, Laminaria solidungula, which increases its annual production by more than half over 8-months of continuous ice cover when irradiance levels are lowest. Reported open-water saturation irradiance in this occurs during the summer, a period of minimal growth, when dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) concentrations are lowest. The project will test the hypothesis that photosynthetic sensitivity in L. solidungula increases considerably during the ice-covered period, and that ambient increases in DIN, not low levels of irradiance, are primarily responsible for seasonal changes in the plant's photosynthetic performance. Several photosynthetic parameters will be calculated from photosynthetic irradiance (P-I) curves derived from radioactive carbon uptake and oxygen flux measurements, and the light harvesting characteristics of entire plants incubated in situ in Beaufort Sea. In the lab, photosynthetic parameters of individuals grown under different conditions of light and DIN over a four-month period will be compared to specifically address the role of these factors in regulating winter photosynthesis at low light levels. In addition, the photosynthetic response of L. saccharina, which is common in temperate regions but is relatively rare in the central Alaskan Beaufort Sea, will be compared to that of L. solidungula. Studies of photosynthesis in both species under natural conditions of light and nutrient limitation will enhance our understanding of photoadaptation and will greatly improve our ability to accurately model kelp production from measurements of in situ irradiance.\n",
      "a9000608 OPP $36492 Gammarid amphipods form an important trophic link between algae and meiofauna, and fishes, birds, and seals in high Arctic latitude environments. Their success may be attributed to physiological mechanisms that allow them to flourish under extreme cold temperatures and changing salinities induced by freezing and melting sea ice. The proposed research focuses on extraordinarily abundant Arctic amphipod that lives in the intertidal zone and under sea ice. Energy cost of osmoregulation will be examined by direct measurement of oxygen consumption in a graded series of salinities and temperatures. Physiological measurements will be complemented by determinations of activity of ion-transport protein: Na-K ATPase. In addition, the ultrastructure of gill membranes will be examined for changes in quantity of ion transport sites and structure as a function of salinity and temperature. The project will be done in collaboration with scientists from the University of Trondheim, and in cooperation with the Norwegian Polar Institute for Arctic Research. Norwegian scientists will be conducting parallel experiments on the response of internal sodium, potassium, chloride and free amino acids to changing salinity and temperature.\n",
      "a9000611 CCR $80752 Stochastic models for NP-complete problems attempt to describe the average case of these problems rather than their worst case. The study of these models is a considerable challenge to the probabilists. The project concentrates on problems where connections with other areas of mathematics can be found. The emphasis is on considering the problems at the greatest possible level of generality (which often makes them look much simpler) and on the use of abstract tools rather than adhoc methods. In the past, progress has been made using empirical processes, martingale inequalities, and the Hahn-Banach theorem. Specific problems to be studied include bin packing heuristics, scheduling problems and the traveling salesman problem.\n",
      "a9000614 CTS $171499 This project is an investigation of the rapid expansion of supercritical solutions (RESS) as a means of producing monodisperse polymer microspheres and of incorporating low molecular weight compounds into the polymer matrix. Polymers studied include polylactic and polyglycolic acids and their copolymers, polystyrene, and polymethacrylates. Low molecular weight co-precipitates studied include the model compounds naphthalene and phenanthrene, as well as progesterone, a contraceptive steroid. The mathematical modeling of the RESS process constitutes the theoretical component of this project. The goal is to understand quantitatively how process variables influence the size distribution of RESS powders. Precipitation in RESS occurs as a result of a sudden expansion which propagates at the speed of sound. This leads to essentially uniform supersaturation in the nucleating medium, giving rise to particles with narrow size distributions. The nonideality of supercritical solutions gives rise to exceptionally high supersaturation ratios upon expansion, and hence to very small particles. To date, the idea of applying this novel process to the production of polymer microspheres for sustained drug release, combining into one step particle production, low molecular weight drug incorporation and size reduction has not been explored. No quantitative treatment of the RESS process exists to date. The proposed model accounts for nonidealities peculiar to supercritical mixtures, such as endothermic solute condensation, and high solvent compressibility. Polymer microspheres are used as chromatography packings, calibration standards, and sustained drug delivery devices. Problems associated with current methods for the production of polymeric microsphere powders include the need for solvent and surfactant elimination, poor control of particle size distribution, and, for drug delivery applications, the difficulty of incorporating drugs into the carrier particles uniformly and at high concentration. For micron or sub-micron particles, which can be made monodisperse but are colloidally stable, purification and drying are especially difficult steps. The RESS process has the potential for unifying particle production, incorporation of low molecular weight drugs, purification, and size reduction in a single step leading to solvent-free microspheres with a narrow size distribution. The resulting reduction in sample loss and contamination is especially important in drug delivery applications.\n",
      "a9000615 DMS $16325 The principal investigator will conduct research on three problems connected with the theory of asymptotic distributions of sums of independent, identically distributed random variables. The first problem is to completely determine the asymptotic distribution of the studentized version of an intermediate, magnitude-trimmed sum for symmetric distributions. The second problem is to empirically reconstruct the distribution of a sum of intermediate length. An affine reconstruction is proposed, via center, scale, and an approximation to the affine-normalized law. The third problem is to investigate a location-invariant approach to magnitude-censoring for sums, utilizing a new centering and scaling technique developed by the principal investigator. The principal investigator will conduct research on three problems connected with the theory of asymptotic distributions of sums of independent, identically distributed random variables. This area of research, limit theory, is at the core of much of classical probability. Problems in this area have been motivated by statistics.\n",
      "a9000616 DMS $165000 This project continues mathematical research focusing on complex analytic methods applied to the analysis of convolution equations, integral geometry and systems of algebraic equations. Earlier work on interpolation problems in spaces of entire functions has led naturally to questions concerning multidimensional convolutions equations. One is actually interested in the question of deconvolution. Many physical realizable systems such as transducers and sensors can be modeled as convolution with distributions. This gives rise to a scheme to estimate signals such as images, radiation, acoustics, etc. The data are given as a convolution plus noise and the reconstruction process in this project consists of finding systematic ways of constructing deconvolvers. In pursuing this work, several mathematical problems arise which are treated as distinct objectives. They include finding the degrees and height in the algebraic Bezout equation, obtaining new properties and representations of residue currents (multidimensional residues) and questions in integral geometry related to the Pompieu problem. The Pompieu problem actually covers a vast array of questions concerning integrals of a fixed function over various congruent configurations. If the integtrals equal zero on a class of congruent sets, one is interested in knowing whether or not the function must be zero. Most of this work is set within the framework of several complex variables. Techniques of analytic function theory and harmonic analysis are predominant. Diverse applications to systems theory and engineering are expected.\n",
      "a9000619 IIS $125945 While implementing temporal data models can dramatically increase the expressive power of a database management system (DBMS), processing efficiency is critical to its success. The potentially enormous sizes of historical data, coupled with the complexity of many temporal operators, pose challenges to the practical implementation of a temporal DBMS. In this project, key issues related to the optimization of temporal database processing are investigated. The focus of the work is on joins which are found in the most common and costly queries. Optimization algorithms for the various join operators, data organizations, and data structures are be developed. An essential component of the optimization process is estimating the size of intermediate results. Temporal relations are distinct from snapshot ones, and conventional estimation techniques are inadequate. Consequently, a new mathematical approach to estimating selectivities for temporal data need be developed. As part of this project the alternative algorithms are first be simulated and analyzed. Then two prototypes (one on top of an existing relational DBMS, while the other is a direct implementation of important temporal operators) are built to further evaluate the optimization concepts. The results of this research will have an impact on database technology by providing a methodology for development of efficient temporal database systems.\n",
      "a9000621 EID $43105 This REU Site activity directly addressed the challenge of increasing the enrollment of women and minorities in engineering graduate study. The key aspects of this program are: 1) the active recruitment of minorities and women by visiting carefully selected \"target\" schools, and 2) a student oriented research program that contains social as well as instructional aspects designed for successful integration of the participants into an exciting research environment. Ten faculty members have volunteered to support recruitment, instruction, and research supervision. The projects offered span a wide range of research, from plant tissue culture, to thermodynamics held together by common chemical engineering principles. REU participants will be matched with projects prior to selection to maximize mutual interests and capabilities. The participants will enroll in a three credit undergraduate research course during the 1990 summer semester. An instructional program at the beginning of the program has been designed to give the students a quick start on research. To stress the importance of communication, an introductory final and oral presentation, as well as a final written report will be required of each student.\n",
      "a9000624 DMS $24000 In this Research Experiences for Undergraduates project, six students will work with faculty advisors relating advances in computational technology to mathematical research. The emphasis of the work will be on computational aspects of two areas: group theory and dynamics. Following initial orientation, students will break up into teams, concentrating on one of the two themes. The interplay between experimentation and theory will enable the students to deal, at an early stage, with complicated examples which cannot be done by hand. These will lead to a better understanding of groups, dynamical systems and their underlying structure. Students concentrating on group theory will be introduced to fundamental concepts of computational group theory through permutation groups and exposure to CAYLEY and other programming languages capable of symbolic manipulation. Dynamical systems will build on students' basic courses in calculus and linear algebra to investigate properties of orbits such as period doubling and saddle node bifurcations, Mandelbrot sets and the generation of fractal images using iterated functions systems. As the students become more familiar with computer experimentation, they will be exposed to problem areas and unsolved problems on which they will focus their attention for the remainder of the activity. Interspersed with the research program will be an evening lecture series in the sciences, history and literature.\n",
      "a9000626 EID $66440 REU site project on infrastructure innovations is designed to attract native born students to research careers in this area within civil engineering and to lead participants toward independent research. Recent reports have concluded that there is a critical need for more research in innovative means of maintenance and rehabilitation of our infrastructure. Research projects include behavior of fiber- reinforced composite pvfs materials, holographic measurement of the fracture process increment, increasing transportation system capacity by changing patterns of usage, and innovative infrastructure enhancement. Student interaction is maintained by twice a week orientation meetings which address research skills common to all work, as well as informal chats with the REU professors to convey the excitement of a research career.

      "a9000631 DMS $58850 The principal investigator will study the relationship between the spectrum of the Laplacian of a manifold and the geometry of that manifold. This will include an investigation of the relationship between the spectrum and geometric properties such as diameter and injectivity radius, as well as a trace formula for Riemannian manifolds. The project will include a study of eigenvalue estimates in the context of obtaining finiteness and compactness results for isospectral manifolds. The problems to be addressed in this project are extensions of Mark Kac's famous question, \"Can you hear the shape of a drum?\" Mathematicians would ask if the spectrum of sound frequencies radiating from a drum can be used to distinguish between different shaped drums. In two dimensions these frequencies can be used to make such distinctions, but in higher dimensions they can not. The principal investigator will study whether or not other mathematical distinctions between objects other than their exact shapes, can be determined by an analysis of their sound spectrums.\n",
      "a9000632 EID $20450 Support for an NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site is continued. The NSF support for 10 undergraduate students each year will allow them to become involved in the research activities of the faculty. This experience is designed to provide students with an improved understanding of research and to encourage them to consider careers in research. Support for this REU will provide continuity for our program carried out in the summers of 1988 and 1989, supplement the commitment to such research activities, and provide students with the opportunity to participate in ongoing cutting-edge research projects. The research activities span the areas of expertise of the faculty in civil engineering and include projects in water resources, bioengineering and pollution control, and structural mechanics. Components of the program include identification of exceptional students through nationwide recruitment with emphasis on women and minority participation; matching of student research interests with faculty; close interaction of graduate students and faculty; close interaction of graduate students and faculty with the undergraduates to provide students with a fuller appreciation of graduate study, university research, and careers in academia; an intense two month research experience; mini-courses, as needed, to facilitate effectiveness in the research projects; and a mini-conference for presentation of results. The goal of the program is to excite some of the best engineering students in the nation about the challenges of a career in research.\n",

      "a9000638 EAR $20000 SAGE (Summer of Applied Geophysical Experience) is a multi-week, university-level research experience focused on modern geophysical exploration. In 6 years of operation since 1983, 163 undergraduate students (including 33 women) have participated in research using seismic reflection and refraction, gravity, magnetics, electrical resistivity, electromagnetics, and magnetotellurics. The SAGE field area in the Rio Grande rift near Sante Fe, New Mexico provides a stimulating tectonic research environment as well as an opportunity to study occurrences of groundwater and hydrocarbons. SAGE students participate in every phase of the field research from the collection and processing of data to its interpretation culminating with both an oral and written report. SAGE research is now focused on characterizing a classic rift accommodation zone. SAGE is sponsored by the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) Branch of the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics of the University of California and six universities who furnish faculty and over $2,000,000 worth of geophysical equipment.

The specific research topics selected for the program are of fundamental, as well as, current engineering interest including several to be conducted with external support and collaborations. A five-member faculty team from the host institution will supervise the project activities. Research projects are thermal compatibility for metal- ceramic systems, properties of liquid metal-liquid insulator interfaces, control-structure interaction of large flexible spacecraft, and diffraction studies of defect substructures in bulk single crystals. Participants will be recruited from both inside and outside the host institution with special attention given to attracting qualified minority, handicapped and female students. The interinstitutional cooperative arrangement is intended to facilitate the recruiting effort, allow several participants to work in on-going joint projects to gain research experience and generally enhance the impact of the REU program by spreading its benefits beyond host site.

      "a9000641 CHE $433525 With support from the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, Professor Nesbitt is investigating the spectroscopy, structure, and dynamics of jet cooled, weakly bound molecular complexes. This work exploits high resolution spectroscopic information on vibrational transitions to help characterize and understand the weak molecular forces so crucial to a variety of chemical, biological, and physical processes. Using a combination of high sensitivity differential beam absorption techniques with multipass infrared probe geometries and pulsed slit valves for long pathlength absorptions, Nesbitt's laboratory is measuring high resolution, sub-Doppler vibrational spectra of various jet cooled complexes. Systems being studied include van der Waals and hydrogen-bonded dimers, dimers of polyatomic molecules, and diatomic molecules bound to several rare gas atoms. Rotationally-resolved vibrational overtone motions are being pumped and characterized by infrared-infrared double resonance techniques in hydrogen-bonded complexes and the resulting photofragments probed for internal state distributions. Intermolecular potential information for multidimensional potential surfaces is being extracted using quantum mechanical simulations of the observed high resolution spectral data.\n",
      "a9000643 DMS $19910 Support for five undergraduate students engaged in mathematical research will be supported by this Research Experiences for Undergraduates award. The students will perform numerical analysis, investigate difference equations and engage in studies of chaos as modeled by the process of iteration of continuous maps. The main focus of the research will be on the oscillatory behavior of difference equations and the role of symmetry in chaotic planar dynamics. The program will run for eight weeks. Faculty from the University of Houston (UH) will also participate in the program. This will be done in several ways. First, the University of Houston will provide a faculty member to work with the students on problems of differential equations and chaos. A second faculty member from Furman University will teach the necessary introductory material on chaos. Her salary will be paid by UH. Students will spend each Friday morning at UH visiting laboratories such as the Dynamics Laboratory and laboratories in the Departments of Physics, Mechanical Engineering and Chemical Engineering where chaotic dynamics is observed experimentally. A portion of the program's research component will involve transferring of software, which has been developed at UH to study iterates of mappings and dynamics with symmetry, to the PC environment which is being developed at TSU. A study of these mappings can be made at many levels, from proving theorems in group representations to parameter exploration in quadratic maps. In addition, UH will provide funds for three REU students to work with the five from TSU. An active program of colloquium lectures, counselling and social events is also planned. Students will be encouraged to present the results of their work at the annual meeting of the Association of Minority Professors.\n",

The program will focus on reduction of stress and enhancement of stress resistance in plants via cellular and molecular techniques. This emphasis parallels the principal research theme of the Center for Agricultural Molecular Biology (AGBIOTECH) at Cook College, which will coordinate and administer the program. Eight students (including women and minorities) will be recruited through professional networks in New Jersey and nearby states to participate in an intensive three-month summer program centered around student research projects and including weekly seminar and journal club meetings; Up to nine credits for the program may be earned through independent study options.

      "a9000645 DMS $32000 A research program focusing on mathematical problems in matrix theory will be supported through this Research Experiences for Undergraduates award. Eight students will work under the supervision of seven faculty members, using experimental and theoretical methods on a broad range of research topics. An introduction to available sophisticated computing tools for mathematical exploration in matrix analysis: MATLAB, Mathematica, Maple and GAUSS, will be provided, along with access to a new computer laboratory. It is expected that students will present their work at regional meetings of the Mathematical Association of America. Research projects such as the approximation of functions of matrices will be taken up. Here one considers interpolating polynomials of complex functions and how the corresponding functions of matrices approximate one another. Another area of investigation concerns the convergence of products of matrices. For powers of a single matrix, the behavior of the sequence of its powers is well known. When the terms of the product are selected from a finite set of matrices, relatively little is known about convergence. Work will also be done on the relationship of the spectrum of a matrix and its permanent. For example, one would like to know the maximum permanent taken over all matrices with a given spectrum. Other topics include extreme points of nonnegative matrices, matrix equation and sign pattern matrices.\n",
      "a9000647 DBI $40060 The award provides funds to the Natural Science Division at Pepperdine University to enhance an already active program of undergraduate research in biology by teaching students the common elements of the research process and increasing their appreciation for the diversity of biological subdisciplines. In addition, the program provides a mechanism whereby students from traditionally underrepresented groups in science will have the opportunity to experience biological research. The program will begin in the summer with a 6-day research orientation workshop at the Murchison Science Center during which students will be introduced to the uses and limitations of specific research tools and techniques and immersed in the research process (literature review, hypothesis formulation, and hypothesis testing). After the orientation workshop, students will pursue individual research projects under the direction of faculty in either ecology, cellular biochemistry, or neurobiology. All research projects will be designed to provide students with insight into how scientists formulate research questions, design experiments, collect and analyze data, and communicate their results to the scientific community. Over the course of the summer, visiting scientists will hold special research seminars in each research area, giving students an opportunity to discuss their own data with other scientists. Each research group will hold weekly literature seminars to discuss current journal articles pertaining to their research interests. The program will conclude with a student research symposium in early August.\n",

      "a9000650 DBI $124312 This award provides funds to continue a Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site at the Population Research Center in the University of Texas, Austin. Demography is a technical field within sociology in which minorities are under-represented. This under-representation may stem from weaknesses in the typical undergraduate curriculum, combined with the low enrollment of minority students at colleges with strong demography programs. The University of Texas at Austin supports a strong, active research program in minority group demography. This has had notable success in training minority demographers, especially Mexican-Americans. There has now been some spillover to the undergraduate program, with more undergraduates taking demography and seeking research assistantships. This REU site will strengthen these developments and extend them beyond the campus. The REU Site has three specific objectives: (1) to provide undergraduate sociology students with more intense technical demographic training than is currently available in most undergraduate sociology curricula; (2) to provide \"hand-on\" experience with faculty-led research teams conducting externally- funded projects on topics related to minority-group demography; (3) to encourage undergraduate participants to develop scholarly papers based on their summer research experience and to present them at a regional sociology meeting in March of the following year.\n",

      "a9000654 EAR $87900 Direct calculation of the structural and spectral properties of chemical species occurring in minerals and in hydrothermal solutions will be performed using proven techniques from molecular quantum chemistry. For halide, oxide and sulfide complexes of 1st transition series metals the P.I.'s will calculate equilibrium structures, vibrational frequencies and electric field gradients. They will study both complexes existing in solution, such as aquated Zn(SH)n2-n, and molecular cluster models for species occurring in minerals, such as Fe(OH2)62+. One goal of the study will be to encourage the use of transition metal NMR within geochemistry. They will also calculate Mossbauer parameters (chemical isomer shift and electric field gradient) for Fe in various oxide and sulfide environments using conventional SCF methods. They will continue their studies of the electronic properties of sulfur containing ligands and their interaction with transition metals. They will also continue our studies of polarizabilities and NMR shieldings of oxidic molecules containing B, Al, Si and P. They plan to study polarizability anisotropies for less symmetric species and to more accurately include the influence of counterions. Similarly, studies of isotropic NMR shieldings for silicate species will be extended to study NMR anisotropies in lower symmetry environments. Finally, a series of experiments and theoretical studies will be completed for small ring systems.\n",

      "a9000687 DMS $72000 Eight undergraduate students will be supported by this Research Experiences for Undergraduates award. They will work under the direction of two faculty advisors on mathematical problems concerned with inverse conductivity. The prototype of such problems is that of finding electrical conductivity of a body knowing only the surface voltages and currents. The discrete (and very difficult) analogue of this problem occurs when one replaces the conducting medium with a network of resistors. If the boundary current is known, then an algorithm exists which determines the resistances. One of the problems the students will work on is that of determining the boundary current from the potential. With that, they will go on to consider questions such as determining the size of the largest network for which the algorithm works, the detection of resistors of zero or infinite conductivity. In addition, work will be done in an effort to determine the shape of the region from surface currents, in estimating the degree of approximation one gets by replacing continuous media by a discrete network. Many other related problems will arise naturally which will provide realistic challenges to the students while assisting the senior investigators with their on-going research programs.\n",

Written reports at the end of the program are required. Where possible, students will be encouraged to rewrite the reports for publication and presentation at professional meetings. Research projects include studies on birigid graphs in the plane and their excess (the number of edges which can be discarded without destroying rigidity). The problem to be taken up concerns the existence of minimal birigid graphs with arbitrary excess. Combinatorial characterizations of birigid graphs in higher dimensions will also considered. Work will be done on bifurcation problems in autocatalytic chemical reactions. These reactions are prime examples of nonlinear systems whose modeling (reaction diffusion equations) are not well understood.

Working within a frame work for participation in research, REU students would choose from a range of projects dealing with fluid mechanics, hydraulics, hydrology/hydrometeorology, and ice (solid water) engineering. The particular aim, and challenge set for each student would be for him/her to undertake a self-contained piece of research within the scope of each project.\n",
      "a9000759 EID $46925 Because of high population of minority students in the southwestern United States and the low percentage that pursue higher education, it is important that educational tools be developed to encourage these students to pursue and succeed in engineering and science fields. In addition to the minority students, many students in this region graduate from small, rural schools with poor training for college. The combination of these students (non-conventional students) have different problems from traditional students. A solution to this problem is the proposed model environment, which involves both students at Texas Tech University and area Community Colleges in meaningful research. This research interaction and mentoring by faculty members will provide an immediate feedback for the value of math and science, enhancing both the efficiency and quality of higher education. The faculty mentoring to students have established records of research, such as the Texas Tech Granular Flow Model and the Texas Tech Wind Erosion Model. A goal for each student researcher is a published technical paper. This work will develop pride and self- worth for the student. The Student would be exposed to engineering research principles in the areas of soil and water conservation, processing of agricultural, food and industrial products, and development of renewable resources.\n",

      "a9000795 EAR $65519 The geologic histories of the Taconic Fold/Trust Belt, the Cambro-Ordovician Platform, the Adirondack massif of eastern New York and western Vermont, and the Main coastal volcanic province are reasonably well-understood. In fact, this area has served as a foundation for the development of ideas relating plate tectonic processes to the growth of mountain belts (e.g. Rogers, 1968; Zen, 1971; Bird and Dewey, 1971). While the general geologic history and major processes are known, there remain many second- order problems which require resolution. This proposal presents a number of geological research projects which are both tractable to undergraduate juniors and seniors and are of significance in refining our understanding of the region. We will also offer students the opportunity to work on problems related to aqueous geochemistry, clay mineralogy, paleontology and geomorphology. All proposed summer projects will be supervised by faculty at Colgate University, with additional fall-semester follow-up independent course work available at cooperating institutions.\n",

      "a9000803 DEB $45422 Morphometrics is the study of shape and shape change, and it combines aspects of geometry and statistics. Morphometrics has wide applications in systematic biology: quantitative description of species and their differences; characterization of the changes that occur during the development of an individual organism and the evolution of a lineage; and the study of processes that impact on these differences and changes. The field of morphometrics has made rapid advances in the past decade, stemming from the availability of desk-top image analysis systems driven by microcomputers, and the development of several new conceptual approaches to the capture of biological shape information. The limiting factors to the further growth of biological morphometrics have been the lack of appropriate microcomputer software, and the high training threshold that investigators face when attempting to use morphometrics in their research. The Systematic Biology Program of the National Science Foundation supported a two-week training workshop at the University of Michigan in 1988, during which 35 faculty-level researchers were given hands-on training in morphometrics. Since that workshop, a new battery of software packages have been developed by the instructors, to be published with the Workshop Proceedings volume in 1990. Dr. Michael Bell and F. James Rohlf propose a second two-week morphometrics training workshop, to be held on the Stony Brook campus of the State University of New York. The Proceedings volume and associated software will be the principal material used in the course, which will train approximately 30 systematic biology researchers in the latest approaches to morphometrics. The proposed training workshop will have wide implications throughout systematic and evolutionary biology. The participants will represent different taxonomic groups and research philosophies, and they will return to their host institutions after the workshop prepared to use and teach the use of an important new research tool. They will be in a position to write competitive grant proposals for equipment acquisition and morphometric research. During the workshop, possible new approaches will be discussed and the place of morphometrics in systematic research will take new form. The workshop will be an important test of the software prior to publication. Training workshops such as this are cost-effective ways to disseminate new methodologies and technologies.\n",

      "a9000833 DBI $126000 This award provides ongoing support to The Jackson Laboratory, a private, non-profit research institution, to continue their Research Experience for Undergraduates Site. In 1990 12 undergraduates, selected from a nationwide group of applicants, will conduct independent hands-on research for 9 weeks in the summer under the direct supervision of staff scientists. Working in their sponsors' laboratories, the students conduct original basic research on problems in mammalian genetics and development that are components of their sponsors' on-going research programs. Students gain experience in all aspects of doing a research project, from project design to reporting the results. Inbred and mutant laboratory mice are utilized in many projects. All students are from outside the host institution; about half are from baccalaureate colleges. Students with a wide range of science preparation are accepted, with each participant's research project tailored to his or her individual background and interests. The students' work at the bench is supplemented by organized group educational activities, including a formal symposium. Follow-up activities are in place to help foster the students' continuing interest in science and research. Informal studies of program alumni indicate that a very high percentage receive doctoral degrees in the biological sciences or medicine.\n",
      "a9000838 OCE $141667 Traditionally, measurements of U-th-Ra isotopics in young mid-ocean ridge rock have been made by alpha sepctroscopy. Thus the ability to see into the volcanic system, and into the mantle, has been limited by the precision and large sample requirements of the counting techniques. Recent acquisition of a Isolab 54 mass spectrometer will enable the principal investigator to make more precise measurements. Thus the first-order goals of this project are to: continue development of necessary analytical techniques; learn more about the behavior of U, Th,and Ra in magma systems; and try to understand the nature and causes of U/Th fractionations that occur in the mantle prior to and during melting, and during subsequent melt transport and fractionation in the mid-ocean ridge plumbing system.\n",
      "a9000839 DMS $117400 The research in this project is concerned with the theory of matrices and operators. The problems under consideration include matrix completion problems; determinantal inequalities for positive definite matrices; algebraic Riccati equations; interpolation for rational matrix functions; qualitative matrix theory; spectral assignment in infinite dimensions; and interpolation of strong forms of nonsingularity. A matrix is a rectangular array of objects. Given two matrices there is a notion of how to add them and how to multiply them. This rather general setting turns out to be very useful in describing situations which arise in many areas of science. This project is concerned with the theory of matrices.\n",

      "a9000874 DMS $24000 Six undergraduates engaged in mathematical research on problems in cooperative game theory will be supported by this Research Experiences for Undergraduates award. Cooperative game theory is a good field for facilitating undergraduate discovery. It is not normally included in the traditional undergraduate curriculum, it provides a source of excellent applications to real world problems and its relatively small body of literature is approachable and not highly technical. Topics to be considered include value axiomatics, an area whose goals are to characterize values by sets of properties and to determine the classes of games on which well-known values satisfy certain properties - properties usually prompted by intuitive notions of fairness or bargaining power. Applications of values is another theme which involves applications such as airport landings, traveling salesman and other assignment strategies. Other topics for students include studies of multi-alternative voting power. Indices, matroidal simple games and the complexity of simplex calculations of the nucleolus of a game. Ample computer and library facilities are available for the students. Each student will write a final report based upon the research completed. It will then be prepared for journal submission, presentation at a professional meeting or used as a basis for an honors thesis. A newsletter will be circulated to maintain contact between participants and advisors.\n",

Post program follow-up efforts will include presentation of results to biology and science clubs in participants' home schools, state collegiate academies of science and publication in appropriate journals.\n",
      "a9000877 DMS $126158 This project is concerned with the study of the steady states of partial differential equations. In particular, the principal investigator is interested in existence, multiplicity and symmetry questions for solutions of semilinear elliptic problems. The project consists of two parts. In the first part the principal investigator considers semilinear problems involving a parameter and studies the solution structure of the problem for the parameter in a neighborhood of an eigenvalue of the linear part of the problem. Here the principal investigator is mainly interested in semilinear problems whose nonlinear part involves bounded oscillatory terms (Sine Gordon type problems). For such problems the multiplicity of ground states (positive solutions) appears intimately dependent upon the dimension of the independent variable and the geometry of the underlying domain. In fact, very little is known for domains which are not convex. In the second part the principal investigator studies the question of symmetry breaking and the development of interior and boundary layers for positive solution branches of semilinear elliptic problems. Here the principal investigator is mainly interested in problems where the domain is either a sphere or a convex domain with certain reflection symmetries.\n",

      "a9000892 CTS $131477 Quantitative description of the primary nucleation kinetic region is vital to the state-of-the-art in hydrate research. Without kinetic research, the basic physics and chemistry cannot be used to interpret the fundamentals of hydrate formation. Since the kinetics of primary nucleation from liquid water seems experimentally elusive and resists duplication in different laboratories, the starting point must be experiments which are reproducible - those kinetic data obtained for hydrate formation from ice. This first step has useful analog for later extension to hydrate formation from liquid water. The impact of the proposed research represents a part of a turning point in the history of hydrate research from time- independent studies (thermodynamics) to time-dependent (kinetic with physical forces) studies. The results of the work are too long-range to be supported by industry. Yet the results have impact on such diverse problems as rates of gas release from hydrates for environmental problems, energy recovery, and the plugging of pipelines in the North Sea environment.\n",
      "a9000893 DEB $9845 Gradute student Morefield under the guidance of Dr. Loren Rieseberg of the Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden is studying the several species of an American Southwest sunflower relative, Stylocline, and its relatives, in order to assess levels of genetic and genomic variability within and among populations of these annual and highly inbreeding plants. Primary methods of analysis include protein electrophoresis to sample variation in soluble enzymes extracted from the plants, along with methods of DNA analysis to measure mutational differences in nuclear ribosomal genes and in chloroplast genes. Several related groups of plants also will be studied, in order to construct a phylogenetic framework indicating evolutionary relationships among the species. Much of the theoretical discussion about speciation processes relies upon knowledge acquired from organisms that cross-breed, but many groups of plants include high proportions of self-fertilizing individuals. It is unclear whether these inbreeding groups follow the same evolutionary rules, and whether they harbor similar amounts of genetic variability within local populations. With additional data from studies of morphological features, the student will also be able to determine reliable features for species identification, map geographic distributions for all the taxa, and evaluate the correct scientific names for all those groups with distinguishable characteristics. The student will thus gain valuable training in a broad range of modern systematic methods in the analysis of plant diversity.\n",

      "a9000925 EEC $315000 In todays extremely competitive manufacturing markets the optimization and upgrading of manufacturing process and procedures is a continual process. Grinding has traditionally been a final machining operation, performed on components to impart required dimensional accuracy and surface finish. Current trends in research, however, have led grinding to the high stock removal regime where in areas such as creepfeed grinding and high speed centerless grinding, process developments have allowed grinding to compete with other primary machining operations such as milling and turning. Fundamental studies, particularly in Europe, have resulted in predictable grinding operations which yielded both higher quality and increased productivity. Thus it is essential that this new technology be brought to American industry. This award establishes an Industry/University Cooperative Center for Grinding Research at the University of Connecticut. The Center's research theme is to conduct fundamental and advanced level studies of the grinding process, and to develop and maintain a grinding data base accessible to industry. Six industry members have already joined the center providing $300,000 in support. The University of Connecticut has agreed to forego its overhead charges (approximately $175,000 per year). In addition, industrial members have also contributed equipment to the center and adequate computers, laboratory space and instruments for the proposed research are in place. The Program Manager recommends that the University of Connecticut be awarded $75,000 each year for five (5) for the initiation of the Center for Grinding Research and Development. $50,000 is to come from the I/UCRC program and $25,000 is to come from the Manufacturing Systems Program (Marvin F. Devries, Program Director). Near the end of each 12-month period, the Program Manager and/or Director of the Engineering Centers Division will review the progress of the Center on a number of renewal criteria, including the following: (1) extent to which university/industry interaction and collaboration is developing: (2) extent to which the support base for the center is expanding; (3) extent to which a rebust research program is developing. If review is satisfactory, the Program Manager will recommend support of the next period of this continuing grant.\n",

      "a9000927 CMS $159750 Water-saturated sandy soils are susceptible to liquefaction when subjected to strong ground shaking, such as occurs during an earthquake. Liquefied soils experience a decrease in bearing strength: this can lead to the partial or total collapse of buildings standing on liquefied soils. The aim of this project is to verify the analyses used to predict liquefaction due to earthquake loading. Since the field data needed for this verification is extremely difficult to obtain, data is being used instead from laboratory experiments performed on geotechnical centrifuges. This is a relatively new technique for soil testing which is becoming well accepted in the geotechnical research community. The technique for simulating earthquakes on centrifuges is being developed, and the results obtained have generated confidence in the method: questions that remain to be answered are being addressed in this study. Different geotechnical structures, including sloping ground, dams, coastal dikes, and embankments are being investigated so as to validate the applicability of the liquefaction analysis methods to a variety of geotechnical structures. Class A predictions - which involve predicting the soil response without knowing the measured results - are used for later comparison with measured results. The Earth Technology Corporation is responsible for the management of the project, for providing carefully calibrated soil samples, for overseeing the testing program, as well as being responsible for receiving, distributing and documenting data, in conjunction with the Adjudication Committee. It is also responsible for managing the prediction studies. The Adjudication Committee acts as an independent steering group. The participating institutions are the University of California at Davis and Berkeley, the California Institute of Technology, the University of Colorado, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Princeton University, and Cambridge University, England. Collectively, they are examining the mechanisms of liquefaction, the development and verification of analytical and numerical models, soil-structure interaction for conditions of limited and large deformations, and the effect of interfaces between soil layers of differing permeabilities. This study will contribute significantly to improving the understanding of the soil liquefaction phenomenon, and to the reliability of methods used to predict the occurrence of liquefaction and the resulting damage to structures. This action is for support of the program at Cambridge University, England.\n",
      "a9000930 CCR $99990 This project continues NSF previously funded research in Distributed Language-based Environments. The objective of this project is to develop a formal model, underlying algorithms and proof-of-concept implementation of change propagation, which is modelled as parallel and distributed incremental evaluation of an attribute grammar defining centralized or decentralized attributed parse trees in response to multiple asynchronous subtree replacements on a tree. In this project, algorithms for several aspects of such change propagation will be investigated, including support for multiple agents initiating subtree replacements, maintenance of underlying data structures, and coordination of evaluation processes, with particular consideration to tradeoffs between attribute evaluation and bookkeeping costs. The initial application is to multi-user distributed language-based programming environments, where programmers employ workstations connected by a local area network and modify segments (modules) in a decentralized attributed parse tree (program).\n",

      "a9000937 DMS $163250 One investigator will study the behavior and singular structure of area-minimizing surfaces using calibrations. On Riemannian manifolds calibrations provide distinguished representatives of homology classes. A wide range of open problems arising from the study of isoperimetric inequalities, materials science, and soap films compel the consideration of integrands more general than area and of new classes of surfaces. A second investigator will continue his studies of volumes of hyperbolic 3-manifolds and 3-orbifolds. These include the study of horoball packings which has shed new light on the geometry of hyperbolic 3-manifolds. An example of a calibration of the torus is the set of longitudinal circles. As in this case, elements of a calibration are homology class generators. These have minimal length. One investigator will use the emerging theory of calibrations to understand assorted integrals on area-minimizing surfaces. The second investigator will study the geometry of three-dimensional surfaces, or manifolds.\n",
      "a9000938 DMS $32352 Professor Przebinda will investigate distribution characters of irreducible admissable representations of classical Lie groups from the viewpoint of microlocal analysis. This will be done in the context of Howe's theory of reductive dual pairs. Three problems are involved in the project: (i) characterize a special class of very singular representations of these groups, (ii) calculate the correspondence of wavefront sets induced in Howe's correspondence of representations, and (iii) investigate the resulting system of differential and microdifferential equations. This research is in the theory of group representations. Group theory is basically the theory of symmetry. To take a simple example, when the system in question is invariant under a change in the position of the origin of space, the group of translations naturally arises. While groups are abstract objects, particular situations demand concrete realizations or \"representations\" of the symmetry group.\n",
      "a9000939 PHY $65000 Experiments will continue an investigation of highly-excited molecular hydrogen. These experiments will include measurements of field ionization and autoionization spectra of the triplet nd Rydberg series, two-photon spectroscopy of the triplet np series, and a study of the Stark effect. A new area of investigation will be a novel set of experiments to study reactive collisions of Rydberg H2 with other atoms and molecules. Similar measurements will be extended to other diatomic molecules, including He2, N2. and H1. A new line of research will aim at improving our understanding of complex atoms, such as iron-group elements. This research will combine multi-laser measurements of highly-excited states with MQDT analysis and then will attempt to work downward in energy toward the complex spectral regions observed by classical emission spectroscopy. This approach has the potential to provide new insights and understanding of complex atoms.\n",

      "a9000945 OCE $12975 An important goal of the Multitracers Project is to quantify paleoproductivity (defined as organic carbon flux out of the euphotic zone) off the coast of Oregon from the peak of the last glacial maximum to the present. By accomplishing this goal the PIs will also develop paleoproductivity tracers that can be applied elsewhere in the oceans, and establish the limitations of each tracer. Three sediment trap moorings forming a transect away from the Oregon coast are a key aspect of the tracer calibration. The approach is to apply multiple tracers for productivity-the bulk organic fraction, inorganic elements (Cu,Zn,Ba), organic geochemical biomarkers, and microfossils-to determine when all give consistent information and to determine when each begins to track paleoceanogrphic variables other than productivity. Funding is provided for an additional field season for the Multitracers Project, consisting of two 6-month trap deployments at the two inshore sites. The high-solution sediment trap data and the water column information from the springtime should enable to adequately define winter-spring produtivity events in the region. In addition, the three-year time series of sediment trap fluxes will help understand the interannual variability of productivity in the California Current. This represents a modification to the previously-funded project entitled \"Multitracers to predict paleoproductivity in the California Current System from sediment and sediment trap materials\" (OCE-8609366).\n",

      "a9000959 OCE $18806079 The year for ATLANTIS II begins with an ALVIN cruise on the MId- Atlantic Ridge. ATLANTIS II then enters a shipyard for biannual overhaul before proceeding to a cruise on the West Florida Escarpment and one in the Gulf of Mexico. The vessel then transits the Panama Canal and begins a series of ALVIN programs in the Galapaos Islands, the East Pacific RIse and the Guaymas Basin. An eighteen day non-ALVIN leg coring in the Sea of Cortez is scheduled before the vessel transits to the Juan de Fuca and Oregon Margin areas for and ALVIN dive series. Four legs in the San Diego area complete the year for ATLANTIS and ALVIN. R/V KNORR will return to Woods Hole after a fifteen month shipyard period during which the vessel was repowered and \"stretched\" thirty-four feet. After re-outfitting with science deck gear, the ship will be ready for service about June 15, the first cruise scheduled in a test of the newly reinstalled dynamic positioning system. The Marine-Light-Mixed Layer Program cruise south of Iceleand precedes a program on the Blake Plateau before KNORR transits the Panama Canal to begin the extended cruise scheduled in the South Pacific for the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE). The year ends with KNORR at sea in tech SOuth Pacific on a leg to Tahiti. The year for OCEANUS is comprised of nineteen voyages for a variety of disciplines, most of which are in and out of Woods Hole. The vessel makes an extended trip to the Madeira Islands for the deployment of sensors for the subduction program in the spring. The final cruise series of the year is in the southern tropical Atlantic for recovery and redeployment of gear placed by OCEANUS early in 1989. The year ends with the Vessel dockside in Woods Hole.\n",

This award is intended to help remove language and cultural barriers to U.S.-Japanese cooperative research and to facilitate science and technology exchange.\n",
      "a9000964 BCS $11800 Anthropologists have long recognized that the African apes, of all primates, are most similar to humans. A significant shared derived feature of these animals is their unique knuckle- walking locomotion. A major gap in our knowledge of such locomotor patterns includes the morphological correlates which would allow identification of such patterns from the fossil record. The primary objective of this research is to evaluate the functional relationship between kinematic patterns of knuckle-walking locomotion and the associated morphological features of the forelimb in adult and young African apes. This will be accomplished using two dimensional kinematic analysis, analysis of weight distribution between fore and hindlimbs using pressure sensitive paper, and quantitative analysis of morphological features of forelimb postcrania in interspecific and ontogenetic comparisons. Results from this research will document the allometric variation in movement patterns and associated knuckle-walking morphology. Such a study is essential to account for allometric effects in the reconstruction of locomotor behavior from skeletal material of fossil apes and hominids.\n",
      "a9000968 DMS $38097 Although this mathematical research concerns theory on smoothly bounded domains in the space of several complex variables, the focus is on studying the behavior of solutions of first- and second-order partial differential equations. The main theme is to determine function classes determined by projecting functions onto the spaces of solutions of the differential equations. Specifically, one would like to know if functions in the classical Lebesgue classes, or those which are Holder continuous project onto functions of the same type. The answer depends on the smoothness of the boundary and, possibly, on the dimension of the ambient space. In the case of strongly pseudo- convex domains, results are quite complete. For weakly pseudo- convex domains of finite type in two complex dimensions, the same can be said. This is the current dividing line. The work to be done in this project first will take up the regularity question for the Lebesgue spaces for powers less than one. A concrete approach will be made by focusing on the specific case where the domain is the Siegel upper half plane. In this setting the powerful machinery of harmonic analysis can be brought to bear using existing theory of Hardy spaces. A second line of investigation will center on studies of the regularity of the Szego kernel (projection) in two complex dimensions for domains with a boundary point of infinite type. These types of boundaries have a resistance to dilation - at present the only technique available to prove regularity. Some progress has been made here in showing that the first few terms of the Szego kernel can actually be computed.\n",

Significant research has been done on the problem of determinantal ideals by mathematicians in the three areas of the special year. The purpose of this special year is to bring together researchers in the three areas who are interested in the problem so that they can clarify the current state of affairs and help define a number of promising avenues of research that result form it.\n",
      "a9000970 DEB $8000 Agricultural crops, which are usually planted as genetic monocultures, are notoriously prone to disease. Natural plant populations, by contrast, are rarely as infected by disease; they are also typically genetically variable. Recently, biologists have postulated that the genetic diversity typical of natural populations may be a product of natural selection exerted by disease organisms, but few studies have tested this hypothesis. The investigators will examine the role of disease in maintaining host genetic variation by comparing resistance of closely related species in the mustard family to a rust disease. Some of these mustard species have no genetic variability, whereas other species are genetically variable. For disease to be capable of promoting genetic variation, the disease must exert strong selection on its hosts; that is, it must decrease survival and/or reproduction of the hosts, and resistance must be inherited. The goals of this study are to determine whether these conditions are met, as well as to determine whether the genetically uniform species are less resistant to disease than the genetically variable species, and whether the composition of natural vegetation is different in places with and without this disease.\n",

      "a9000993 OCE $63401 There are a number of major issues relative to mid-ocean ridge magmatism; such as the along-axis compositional variations, the effects of variable magma chamber recharge rates, the distribution of feeders, convective partitioning of a contiguous chamber, tectonic segmentation, trends in fractionation, mixing, and contamination. This study will address the role of variable recharge and/or spatially varying boundary conditions in generating chemical partitioning of a magma chamber. The objective is to determine the time and length scales associated with crystal and convective fractionation where the crystallization is fully coupled to the heat transfer regimes in the wallrock and to the phase diagram for real compositions. This involves the coupling of the transport equations directly to the phase relations of the system through the code SILMIN. An additional objective is to initiate laboratory experiments of convective regimes with appropriately varying boundary conditions. Questions to be addressed include: (1) How will convection be influenced by recharge? (2) How is crystallization and fractionation influenced by convection? (3) To what degree does convection partition the chamber into domains that have difference chemical evolutions? (4) What is the effect of hydrothermal convection on the chamber?\n",

The goal is too obtain comprehensive structural, textural, mineralogical, and fluid/rock chemical information, all within a precisely defined spatial context, related to magma-hydrothermal contacts. Knowledge of the rates and mechanisms of mass and energy transfer across magma chamber margins is necessary to understanding the style and vigor of submarine hydrothermal circulation and ridge- crest magma chamber evolution. This project will utilize models initially developed to study magma hydrothermal systems related to intrusive plutons associated with well-characterized porphyry copper deposits.\n",

      "a9001012 DMS $67554 This project continues mathematical work on modeling, analysis and design of numerical algorithms for physical systems, the behavior of which is heavily influenced by non-local effects in time, space and both. Three classes of such systems are investigated. The first comprises viscoelastic and thermoelastic time-memory models, the second concerns interface problems arising in elastic and electromagnetic scattering by inhomogeneous obstacles, some of which involve non-local operators in space and time, while the third focuses on reaction- diffusion problems in population genetics with state-dependent diffusion velocity. A central theme of this research is a careful study of the strength of damping mechanisms induced by non-local effects and the influence of damping on well-posedness, including variational formulation techniques, asymptotic behavior, and approximation of non-local effects to facilitate easier implementation of numerical methods. The problems require the development of delicate analytical and numerical techniques coupled with a thorough understanding of the underlying physics. Some of this work builds on a recent paper in which the concept of steady-state power loss is introduced as a measure of the strength of damping for models with singular kernels. It is expected that this point of view will prove valuable in the study of global well-posedness and limiting behavior.\n",

It focuses on the relationship of societal opportunities provided by education to commitment to academic performance in a sample of vocational and regular high school students from different socioeconomic backgrounds. Two methods of collecting data will be employed. Students and their mothers will be surveyed on their values, and a qualitative observation will focus on lifestyles of the two high school groups. This study will provide data that may be useful in encouraging academic performance among American high school students.\n",
      "a9001027 DMS $87000 The investigator will study several topics in set theory, primarily concerning the core model and its applications. The major aim is to generalize the core model, first to include everything up to Woodin cardinals, and then to include Woodin cardinals as well. Preliminary results have revealed the probable structure of this core model, and the main remaining problem is to find a condition on the extenders in the core model which will ensure that iterated ultrapowers of the core model are well-founded. Other problems include questions related to the singular cardinal hypothesis, to infinitary Ramsey theory, and to the existence of definable cofinal sequences witnessing the singularity of an infinite singular cardinal. Set theory is usually considered the foundation of all mathematics, so studies of this kind are in a sense exploring the limits of mathematical possibility. What axioms about sets can be trusted as a sound foundation? What economies of proof can be achieved by using stronger set theoretic assumptions? Questions such as these are the motivating forces of this and other projects in set theory.\n",

      "a9001033 CTS $125000 The research objective is to improve the fabrication of optical fibers (waveguides), by using aerosol doping. The proposed method involves the transport and evaporation of an aerosol of solution droplets in the MCVD (Modified Chemical Vapor Deposition) and OVD (Outside Vapor Deposition) techniques. The focus of this research is on the experimental fluid mechanics and heat transfer aspects. The novelty of the proposal consists in the way in which the mist is created by an ultrasonic nebulizer and transported to the deposition surface. This work will be done in collaboration with the modelling effort carried out at Northeastern University. The new techniques for the doping of non-volatile dopants into optical fibers have particular relevance to the fabrication of fiber laser amplifiers for telecommunications purposes. Two graduate students will be prepared in this area with a shortage of specialists.\n",
      "a9001036 DEB $8589 Primary productivity of mangroves is an important source of nutrients for adjacent marine systems. The level of productivity is affected not only by environmental factors but also by other components of the mangrove community. Nutrient enrichment might have direct impact on aquatic food webs by increasing primary productivity of mangroves, but enrichment to coastal waters might be mitigated because as much as 20% of mangrove leaf material is removed by herbivores. The objective of this study is to determine the effects of nutrient enrichment on primary productivity of the key mangrove species, Rhizophora mangle, and on rates of insect herbivory in a controlled experiment in which nutrient availability in sediment is manipulated. The following hypotheses will be tested: 1. Nutrient enrichment causes increased leaf production and terminal branch production, internodal elongation, and flowering. 2. Nutritional quality (e.g., CNP ratio, water content) of mangrove tissues increases following nutrient enrichment of the sediment. 3. Nutritional quality of mangrove tissues correlates with rates of insect herbivory by both leaf feeders (folivores) and twig borers (xylovores). 4. Secondary use of R. mangle twigs by insects and their kin, e.g., predators, parasites, twig-nesting ants, etc., increases with rate of primary herbivory. 5. Proportions of species in the twig-feeding guild of R. mangle change following nutrient enrichment. This research will contribute to the knowledge base on mangrove ecology and may provide important information useful in conservation of mangroves.//\n",
      "a9001042 DMI $250000 A key consideration in a variety of manufacturing processes is controlling either the position or shape of an interface defined as the boundary between liquid and solid materials of dissimilar composition or density to within certain allowable tolerances. Automating these processes requires the ability to monitor and maintain the critical growth interface parameters throughout an entire lengthy batch process using an appropriate process feedback control algorithm. A method will be developed to monitor and subsequently control an interface boundary using an appropriate gamma ray emitting radioisotope and a rugged semiconductor detector. Initial results obtained during the Phase I program indicated that this technique is effective. Further research on this method should lead to a commercially viable control system.\n",

      "a9001045 MCB $5000 This application is for partial funding of a conference on Chromosome Replication and Segregation in Yeast to be held under the auspices of the Federation of American Societies of Experimental Biology (FASEB) from August 5-10, 1990 at the Vermont Academy, Saxton's River, Vermont. Participation in the meeting will be limited to 155 scientists who will be chosen from applicants on the basis of their expertise and interests as being the most likely to help create a stimulating and informative meeting. The topic of the meeting emphasizes research on the chromosome replication and segregation in yeast. While most participants will use baker's yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as an experimental system, scientists using other filamentous fungi will be encouraged to participate. The conference will consist of nine scientific sessions, each with approximately 9 speakers; in addition, one or two afternoons will be devoted to poster sessions and/ or informal group discussions. Approximately half of the speakers from each session will be invited in advanced; the remaining half will be chosen from the pool of applicants. Three sessions will be devoted to DNA replication (cis elements and their associated factors, enzymology, and in vivo analysis of origin usage). Four sessions will be devoted to chromosome segregation (centromeres and their associated factors, the mitotic apparatus, nuclear architecture and new mutational approaches to chromosome transmission). The last two sessions will be devoted to the analysis of the coordination of chromosome replication and segregation during the cell cycle. This meeting will fill an important niche for scientists interested in yeast chromosome replication and segregation by allowing extensive communication between laboratories at the important time this rapidly developing field.\n",
      "a9001046 SES $57000 Until relatively recently, there has been little research on gender differences in the social organization and social contexts of crime and on issues of gender and gender bias in social control, penal practice, and the administration of justice. Scholarship in this area is growing rapidly and is recognized by many as making some of the most significant advances in contemporary criminological research. The theoretical and policy contributions of the research are of global importance. However, researchers working in this area remain isolated and there has been little international communication or coordination. This award is for an international scientific conference of scholars from different countries to discuss gender issues in crime, law, and social control. The conference participants will critically examine theory, methods, and empirical data in an effort to disentangle gender assumptions and biases, gender differences, and what is known about the role of women in different systems of law and social control. Further, and equally as important, the conference seeks to examine the implications for future research and theory in criminology of bringing gender perspectives to bear and doing so in an international, non-ethnocentric way. Approximately thirty participants from 18 countries will attend the conference to be held in Montreal, Canada in July 1991. An edited volume of papers, together with relevant summaries of conference discussions, will be produced. This conference will provide a unique opportunity to pool findings and interpretations, from an international perspective, on concepts of gender in the field of criminology. The products of this conference should have a major effect on the development of scientific research by broadening the conceptual base of what and how the field studies social control, deviance, and crime.\n",
      "a9001047 DEB $6817 Insect herbivores can have large effects on the performance, life histories, and demography of plants, and often exert strong natural selection on plant populations. In addition, plants are often exposed simultaneously to stresses from biotic (i.e. herbivory, parasitism) and abiotic (i.e. resource limitation, heat) sources. This project will use the tallgrass prairie perennial Silphium integrifolium (Asteraceae) and one of its major herbivores, the gall wasp Antistrophus silphii (Hymenoptera:Cynipidae), as a model system to examine how herbivory, nutrient stresses, and water stress interact to affect life history and physiological responses of plants. Experiments will address two specific questions. 1. How does gall infestation affect life-history traits and fitness components of Silphium intergrifolium? 2. How do nutrient limitation and water stress influence the physiological and growth responses of plants to gall insect attack? To answer the first question, plant physiology (i.e. photosynthesis, water potential), growth, biomass allocation, and reproduction will be measured over a two-year period in experimentally galled and gall-free plants growing in natural field populations. The second question will be addressed in a common garden experiment in which gall frequencies and nutrient/water availabilities will be manipulated in a factorial design, and physiology, growth, and reproductive output will again be measured.\n",
      "a9001051 DEB $8248 This project is an integrated study of forest dynamics and ethnobotany in Peruvian Amazonia, which will provide essential data for the sustained use of these highly varied forests. The investigation centers on mortality, ingrowth, and growth rates for trees and lianas >10cm d.b.h. in eight fully identified one- hectare plots established in 1983. Preliminary data indicate major between-site variation in mortality rates; these will be examined for the dependence of forest dynamics and diversity on each other and on soil and climatic variables. For thirteen one- hectare plots, the researchers will take local informants to each identified tree and liana to quantify their knowledge of plant use, and to compare such knowledge between informants. Data on plant use and population dynamics will be used to discover if the common useful species in each plot are regenerating. For selected palm species, the project will compare the effectiveness of canopy diameter, tree height, and d.b.h. as predictors of one year's fruit yield. The research will contribute directly ecological theory of forest dynamics and conservation.\n",

      "a9001056 CHE $249600 Professor Sandra Greer is supported by a grant from the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to study the density, heat capacity and phase equilibria of polymerizing liquids; she will also be testing a number of theoretical models that may be applicable to them. This work will help us to understand how and why polymerization occurs ultimately allowing us to design and produce better plastics, synthetic oils and clothing materials. Greer is pursuing a two pronged attack to find out firstly, if certain theoretical models that have been proposed do in fact correctly predict the behavior of reversible polymerization. These systems often refered to as \"living polymers\" because the polymer-monomer equilbrium can be reversibly shifted by temperature changes; thus, mimicking chemical equilbrium behavior. Secondly, Greer will examine the concept of Wheeler et al. that the static properties (density and heat capacity) can, in fact, be treated as critical phenomena. Moreover, Greer hopes to see whether or not the theories used to predict and describe phase transitions in magnets can also be used to describe her \"living polymer\" systems' reversible equilibria properties.\n",

      "a9001059 DMS $0 This award supports the research on the geometry and analysis of locally symmetric spaces and manifolds of negative curvature of Professor Svetlana Katok of the University of California at Santa Cruz. Dr. Katok's project consists of two main parts: first, she intends to study the cohomological equations associated with geodesic flows on compact negatively curved surfaces; and second, she will generalize spanning theorems that she has already proved for automorphic forms on Fuchsian groups to locally symmetric spaces of dimension greater than two. Non-Euclidean plane geometry began in the early nineteenth century as a mathematical curiosity, but by the end of that century, mathematicians had realized that many objects of fundamental importance are non-Euclidean in their basic nature. The detailed study of non-Euclidean plane geometries has given rise to several branches of modern mathematics, of which the study of modular and automorphic forms is one of the most active. This field is principally concerned with questions about the whole numbers, but in its use of geometry and analysis, as exemplified by the work of Professor Katok, it retains connection to its historical roots.\n",
      "a9001061 DMS $128948 To stimulate interest and activity in mathematical research, the National Science Foundation each year supports a number of NSF-CBMS Regional Research Conferences in the Mathematical Sciences. Each five-day conference features a distinguished lecturer who delivers ten lectures on a topic of important current research in one sharply focused area of the mathematical sciences. The lecturer subsequently prepares an expository monograph based upon these lectures, which is normally published by the American Mathematical Society or the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, or jointly by the American Statistical Association and the Institute of Mathematical Statistics. Certain features differentiate these conferences from typical research conferences. These are: (1) Focus on a single important and timely area of research by a leading practitioner, (2) Continued effect and local stimulation through regional emphasis, (3) Panel review for quality, breadth, and timeliness, and (4) Published monographs for a wider audience.

      "a9001063 CHE $494000 This project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program is in the general area of main-group chemistry and in the specific area of boron hydride chemistry. Boron-hydrogen compounds are of considerable practical interest as starting materials for the synthesis of new materials or for improved syntheses of known materials, such as metal borides. The goal of this project is to develop new synthetic strategies to facilitate high yield selective transformations in boron hydride chemistry. Of especial interest is the use of transition metals to catalyze transformations of polyhedral boranes and carboranes. The use of ruthenium carbonyl compounds to catalyze the insertion of alkynes into polyhedral carboranes will be investigated. Metal-catalyzed alkyne and olefin addition and coupling reactions will be used for the synthesis of alkenyl- and alkyl-boranes. Late transition elements will be investigated as catalysts for isomerizations of carborane cages. Transition metals, particularly Pt(II), will be investigated also as catalysts for dehydro-coupling, -condensation, -cyclization and -cage growth reactions of boranes. In a second major sub-project the syntheses and chemical and structural properties of hybrid polyhedral boranes, such as hypho-dithiaborane clusters, will be investigated.\n",

This project will also study the interaction of the unstable Novikov spectral sequence and the unstable Adams spectral sequence. Using recent work of Davis and Mahowald, he plans to compute many of the James numbers. Both parts of this project involve highly intricate algebraic constructions which lend themselves, surprisingly, to understanding the geometry of some very natural geometric objects, namely the Spin manifolds.//\n",
      "a9001065 DEB $8500 Plants produce many more ovules than develop into seeds. Some ovules may not develop into seeds because pollen tubes fail to reach the ovary and fertilize ovules; other ovules are fertilized and then aborted. The failure of an ovule to develop into a seed can also depend on the genotype of the pollen donor. In general, seeds sired by foreign pollen are more likely to be developed over seeds sired by self pollen when both types of seeds are competing in the same fruit. There have been few investigations attempting to determine the mechanism of preferential development of outcrossed seeds although many authors have hypothesized that variation in pollen tube growth is important. Pollen tubes of certain donors may simply not get to the ovary and fertilize any ovules. Patterns of preferential development could also be caused by selective abortion if seeds sired by self pollen are aborted with greater frequency than seeds sired by foreign pollen. Despite the possible role of seed abortion in determining patterns of preferential development, abortion of seeds sired by specific pollen donors has not been examined in any plant. The proposed work differs from previous studies because it will look at both variation in pollen tube growth and seed abortion. The PIs have developed a technique that enables them to determine the genetic makeup of ovules as they begin to abort. Preliminary data suggest that seeds sired by self pollen are aborted with greater frequency than seeds sired by foreign pollen.\n",
      "a9001066 SES $221952 The purpose of this collaborative project is to extend the Batemen-Foust 1860 data set by collecting data for the same townships from the manuscripts of the 1880 Census of Population and Agriculture. These two data sets will then be linked across households between the two census dates to provide a large scale cross-section/time-series database on families, households, individuals, farms, and communities in the second half of the nineteenth century. The resulting composite database promises important new insights into the development of the American economy at a critical period in its history and offers long term research material for economic historians, demographers, rural sociologists and scholars from other disciplines. It is also of potential interest and relevance for contemporary research since the late nineteenth century witnessed the structural change of America from a rural, agricultural country to an urban-industrial one, a change analogous to the on-going shift from manufacturing to services.\n",

First, the fungus, in response to plastic as well as plant surfaces, produces specialized attachment cells (hyphopodia), which can be at least partially purified. Second, G. graminis is not an obligate parasite and can be easily cultured. Third, the fungus can be manipulated by both classical and molecular genetic techniques. One of our goals is to determine if hyphopodia are important for fungal pathogenicity as suggested by preliminary work. Gene disruption with transforming plasmid DNA will be used to generate more hyp strains which lack the ability to produce hyphopodia. After they are genetically analyzed, mutants will be characterized as to their colonizing and pathogenic potential.\n",

Among the areas of special emphasis are the geometry of submanifolds, symplectic and Poisson geometry, Gauge theory in principal bundles, Lie transformation groups, and complex manifolds. Differential geometry is an outgrowth of multi-variable calculus. Physics has been a rich source of unsolved problems which may be phrased naturally in differential geometric terms. Among these are questions arising from the geometry of space and time first understood by Einstein. Gauge theory is an attempt to go beyond these earlier studies toward a theory which explains both the physics of the small and of the large. This group of differential geometers will study a variety of problems related to modern gauge theory.\n",
      "a9001090 DMS $41325 Professor Fialkow will study several questions in multivariable operator theory concerning the structure of bounded linear operators in Hilbert space and the structure of certain associated C* algebras. One aspect of the research concerns the solution of systems of linear equations in C* algebras. Another facet involves polynomially bounded hyponormal weighted shifts. A final topic is the study of structural and spectral invariants for quasisimilarity of operators. The latter research is particularly concerned with characterizing those operators quasisimilar to the unilateral shift and determining their spectral properties. Hilbert space operators are essentially infinite matrices of complex numbers. These operators have applications in every area of applied science as well as in pure mathematics. This type of research is an attempt to classify certain important categories of such objects.\n",

Flow cytometry is the principal experimental tool used to obtain the desired data. This technique allows rapid and accurate determination of how various properties of single cells are jointly distributed among the many cells in a population, and it can also be used to provide quantitative information on the spatial distribution of some materials, like DNA, in a single cell.\n",
      "a9001096 DMS $5000 Professor Beer has been involved in the study of topologies on the closed convex subsets of a normed linear space. Such topologies give rise to topologies on convex functions, with a function identified with its epigraph, the set of points on or above its graph. In the last two years, Professor Beer introduced a topology compatible with Mosco convergence of sequences of convex sets, showing that it is stable with respect to duality if and only if the underlying space is reflexive. Several characterizations of the topology were obtained, and continuity properties of a variety of operators and functionals on convex sets were studied. In response to the unsuitability of this Mosco topology in the nonreflexive case, and in view of some prior promising results regarding the norm convergence of linear functionals and their level sets, Professor Beer studied the topology of uniform convergence of distance functionals on bounded sets. Not only is this topology stable with respect to duality without restriction, but it is also the right convergence notion in terms of the stability of solutions of convex optimization problems. Professor Beer will continue his studies on convergence of convex sets, with particular attention to connections with Banach space geometry, approximation of multifunctions, and specific operations and functionals. He also hopes to become involved in applications of set convergence in evolving research in the foundations of nonsmooth analysis, e.g., to certain optimization problems.\n",
      "a9001103 DMS $60784 This project will study transport phenomena in symplectic mappings of four or more dimensions. The goal is to partition phase space into regions bounded by partial barriers through which flux occurs. A candidate for such a region is a resonance, defined as a volume in the neighborhood of an elliptic point; its boundary will be obtained from limits of librational periodic orbits. Resonance volumes will be computed and we will determine whether resonances partition phase space. The correlation function for orbits in the neighborhood of a resonance boundary well be studied to determine whether the series for the diffusion tensor converges. Transport will be defined in terms of the flux across resonance boundaries, including branching ratios for transitions from one resonance to a neighboring one, as well as drift along a commensurability channel. To compute the latter a restricted symplectic map will be introduced and studied. Numerical techniques will include frequency filtering and finding periodic orbits.\n",
      "a9001104 BCS $3926 Stones often are found along relatively horizontal planes within soils, appearing as lines in soil cuts, thereby leading to their designation as stone lines. The morphology of stone lines long has been explained in terms of accumulation of mass-wasted or wind-blown deposits over previously settled materials, but recent studies have indicated that stone may be realigned within the same soils through the actions of small mammals and insects. This doctoral dissertation project will test the hypothesis that both the stone line within the Sangamon soil layer in central Illinois and the overlying layer of coarser material are the products of sorting activities by mound- building animals. Stone lines from a sample of sites among drumlins in McDonough County will be examined through analyses of the location and orientation of stones and through biofabric analysis of the materials, which will provide information on the environmental conditions under which the soils evolved. This project will provide a well-structured test of competing hypotheses regarding soil morphology, shedding light on the conditions at the study site and for a broader range of locales. This project also will provide an excellent opportunity for a promising young scholar to continue to develop independent research skills.\n",
      "a9001106 DMR $210000 This research program is to learn about the behavior of liquid mixtures near solid boundaries. The work is primarily experimental. The fundamental issues are the nature of the boundary states, including their microscopic structure; the role and origins of short and long range substrate-liquid interactions; the importance of thermal fluctuations; and the response to thermodynamic forces both in and out of equilibrium. There are three main projects: First, a capillary rise exploration of the transitions between states of wetting at bulk coexistence. The variables here are temperature and the chemistry of the bulk liquids and the substrates. Second, optical studies of the polarization and intensity of reflected light from liquid-solid interfaces as a means of uncovering microscopic features of equilibrium wetting layer structure. Third, the exploration of the nonequilibrium response of wetting structures to temperature changes with time and fluid motion. The aim here is to learn about otherwise inaccessible regimes of equilibrium response as well as time-dependent phenomena. As a supplementary project, they will join with the research group of Benjamin Widom to study the interfacial structure and energy of phase-separated polymer solutions through reflectivity and capillary rise experiments.\n",
      "a9001107 SES $4000 The objective of this dissertation is to explore the impact of organizational linkages, class linkages, and the local organization of work on the structures and ideology of contemporary Latin American popular religious organizations, both evangelical and Catholic. A case-based comparative approach is taken to data gathering and analysis. Cases (within the metropolitan area of Caracas, Venezuela) will be chosen on the basis of the class composition of the neighborhood and type of organizational network within which the local church is embedded. In keeping with the community studies tradition, techniques will include participant observation, interviews with leaders, and member surveys, as well as analysis of background information on the communities. The study will fill a gap in substantive knowledge and contribute to understanding the relation between religion and social class.\n",
      "a9001108 DEB $5400 Although insect herbivores are a diverse group and attack plants in a variety of ways, few studies have compared the impacts of different types of insect feeding on a host species. This research will examine how an insect's feeding style affects its impact by comparing three insects that feed on goldenrod (Solidago altissima): a leaf chewing beetle (Trirhabda sp.), a phloem feeding aphid (Uroleucon caligatum), and a xylem tapping spittlebug (Philaenus spumarius). Plants will be grown in pots and insects will be placed on them at densities that span the range of actual insect densities observed in our long-term censuses of goldenrod insects. Impacts on both reproductive and vegetative growth will be investigated. Effects on fitness will be evaluated by measuring fecundity, mean seed weights, rhizome weights, and nitrogen content of seeds and rhizomes. Plant allocation to buds, leaves, stems, and roots will be determined, as will leaf area and leaf nitrogen levels. A second objective is to see how herbivore impacts vary with the nutrient status of the host plant. Plants will be grown at two levels of soil fertility to see how impacts on plant fitness are effected. It is not currently possible to predict which types of insect feeding will be most damaging to plants, and this study will help to fill that gap.\n",

      "a9001116 BCS $9000 Relatively little is known about the environments of central North America during the early and middle parts of the Wisconsin glacial period, which extended roughly from 70,000 to 25,000 years before the present. Few deposits of materials from the period remain; one of the most important formations that does exist is the Roxana loess, a fine, wind-blown material found in the upper Mississippi River valley. Scientists have disagreed about the origins of these deposits, however, with each alternative explanation providing markedly different interpretation of prevailing environmental conditions. This doctoral dissertation project will use geochemical, particle-size, mineralogical, and radiocarbon analyses to determine the source materials and age of Roxana loess deposits in the Mississippi River valley between LaCrosse, Wisconsin, and Rock Island, Illinois. The results of these analyses will be compared with comparable analyses of deposits from the Illinois River valley to determine whether the loess is composed of materials from local or from glacially transported sources, and the results will provide a firmer basis from which to infer large- and smaller-scale paleoenvironmental conditions and geomorphic processes during the early- and middle-Wisconsin period. This research will provide valuable information for scientists conducting geomorphic and paleoenvironmental research in the upper Midwest, and it will contribute toward reconstruction of regional conditions during the last ice age. The project also will provide an excellent opportunity for a promising young scholar to continue to develop independent research skills.\n",
      "a9001120 DEB $8500 The Plain Titmouse (Parus inornatus) varies in overall size, bill size, and color throughout its range in western North America. Ten geographic forms are currently recognized (American Ornithologists' Union, 1957, Check-list of North American Birds) on the basis of morphology and color. West of the Cascade-Sierra Nevada Mountains, the species occurs commonly in foothill oak woodland. Density is lower in the Southwest and Intermountain Regions, where populations are found patchily in pinyon-juniper or juniper habitat. The goal of this project is to integrate morphologic, molecular, and behavioral data on Parus inornatus in order to elucidate patterns and processes of divergence among populations. Differences in population structure will enable testing of alternative models of gene flow. Hypotheses concerning the role of adaptation and Pleistocene isolation also will be evaluated. A variety of modern systematic techniques will be used to examine patterns of morphologic and genetic variation within and among populations of Parus inornatus. Results to date indicate strong genetic differentiation between Pacific slope and Intermountain populations, on the order of that found between closely related species of birds. Patterns of variation in morphology (especially bill size and shape) and color support the genetic data. A quantitative estimate of gene flow will shed light on the process of genetic and morphologic divergence among populations. Because numerous bird species show similar patterns of divergence between the Pacific slope and Intermountain Regions, this study will contribute to an emerging picture of avian speciation in western North America. The results of this study will likely lead to formal taxonomic changes by the American Ornithologists' Union Committee on Classification and Nomenclature. The identification of genetically and/or morphologically distinct populations will provide critical information for managers concerned with the protection and management of pinyon-juniper or oak woodlands in the western United States. The future of oak woodlands in California is of growing concern because of increasing pressures for development in the foothills of the Cascade-Sierra, Nevada and Coast Ranges.\n",

First, such states with highly correlated motions will be investigated, by observing correlations in energy levels, oscillator strengths, and decay mechanisms. Second, a high power picosecond laser will be used to excite doubly excited states to determine the extent to which excitation occurs in neutral Ba before it decays into an ion and an electron, and to observe the interplay between intermediate and final autoionizing resonances on the process.\n",
      "a9001127 DEB $10000 The Konza Prairie Research Natural Area was established in 1970 using replicated watershed units to study the effects of fire frequency on tallgrass prairie. Seastedt and Benning propose to take advantage of this long-term fire frequency experiment with a retrospective analysis of indices of net primary production (NPP) using remote sensing and Geographic Information System procedures. They will test the hypotheses that 1) fire frequency has measurable effects on remotely sensed indices of foliage NPP, 2) that topoedaphic effects influence watershed patterns, and 3) that growing season precipitation mediates fire frequency effects. The results from this effort will be combined with small plot studies to modify the CENTURY model so that it accurately predicts fire effects on NPP and soil dynamics. This research addresses an important part of vegetation - atmosphere interactions and is related to the problem of detecting effects of global change on biotic processes. The institutional support for this research is outstanding.\n",

      "a9001139 ATM $300000 The history of sea level is an important component of paleoclimate research. It defines the history and rate of ice growth and melting, the slowest component of the atmosphere- ocean-cryosphere system. The best record of sea level is produced by using well-dated coral reef material. This proposal requests support to refine the sea level history for the last 125,000 years and to calibrate the 14C time scale for the last 40,000 years. The PIs will use the elevation and morphometry of the coral reef samples from Barbados and their radiometric ages to extend the sea level record to 125,000 years BP. Comparisons between 14C and 230Th ages of coral samples will be used to calibrate the 14C time scale. This research is important because it will: 1) develop the best possible record of sea level and 2) calibrate the 14C time scale back to about 40,000 years BP. Thus it will be possible to compare on the same time scale the records of climate and the astronomical variations which cause climate change.\n",

      "a9001154 DMS $69000 Various topics in mathematical analysis associated with orthogonal polynomials will be taken up in this project. On the same interval, there are many classes of orthogonal polynomials. In each class, orthogonality is defined with respect to a measure (density) concentrated on the interval. The main theme of this work is a continuing effort to understand the relationship between the measure and the recurrence coefficients of the corresponding polynomials. Associated to each class of orthogonal polynomials is a unique algorithm which produces the higher order polynomials in terms of the lower. This recurrence is a simple linear relation, and it is the coefficients in the relation that are of considerable interest. Methods to be employed include minimizing polynomial integrals (the Christoffel function), asymptotic behavior of difference equations and eigenvalues of infinite tridiagonal matrices. The methods used for studying eigenvalues of matrices can be adapted to the study of solutions of the Schrodinger equation in a central field of force, and the Christoffel function is related to statistical prediction theory. Results of polynomial approximation, a natural by-product of this work, and prediction theory are valuable in digital processing of electronic signals.\n",
      "a9001156 DEB $4421 Extensive evidence suggests that resource quantity and quality can have an important influence on zooplankton community structure. Hypotheses developed in this research describe how the resource base of the zooplankton is expected to vary seasonally among systems with differing trophy and differing nitrogen and phosphorus supply ratios. Predictions are made regarding the response of the zooplankton community to these variations in resource base. The preliminary results of experiments conducted this past summer are discussed as they pertain to the proposed hypotheses. Further research is proposed that will allow evaluation virtually all of the components of the resource base and of the zooplankton community to enrichment at high and low TN:TP ratios.\n",
      "a9001157 DEB $9274 Hybridization has long been important to plant breeding and the production of crop plants. Less well understood, however, is the importance of hybridization in the evolution of wild plants. In part this is because it can be difficult to detect and document the occurrence of hybridization events and to distinguish genetic novelties introduced from another species from natural genetic variation arising within a species by mutation processes. Recently, new and powerful molecular methods for analyzing directly the DNA of plants have made possible a broad analysis of this problem. Graduate student Hanson under the guidance of Dr. Loren Rieseberg of the Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden is studying a presumptive case of repeated hybridization events (termed introgression) between two species of yuccas of the American Southwest. Protein markers are being assayed by electrophoresis, and variation in nuclear ribosomal and plastid DNA is being analyzed by enzymatic restriction-sites. Several related yucca species are also being studied to infer the phylogenetic relationships among species in this group, in order to determine whether the two hybridizing species have shared a recent common ancestor. Recent ancestry can also lead to a pattern of shared genetic markers that could be confused with hybridization. The range of protein and DNA markers to be studied, from both nuclear and chloroplast genomes, will help distinguish between recent common ancestry and current introgression. The study will thus advance understanding of hybridization in natural plant populations, and will help in the training of a young plant scientist.\n",
      "a9001164 SES $4586 This research will examine the understudied area of rural to rural migration in a developing society. It will address the problem of peasant migration into protected forests by investigating two related questions. First, since the development and transformation of peasant classes is one of the most central social dynamics in Thai peasant life, what is the relationship between this development of peasant classes and the movement of farmers out of the fertile core agricultural areas into marginal areas, particularly national forests, where the land is not as productive? Secondly, how has Thai state policy shaped this process of class formation and migration, specifically those state policies concerned with land tenure? By understanding the social and economic sources of migration at both a micro- and macro-level this research could then be applied, in Thailand and elsewhere, to help develop state and local policies that would take into account the often conflicting needs of the individual farmer and the needs of the country as a whole.\n",
      "a9001169 OCE $10177800 Columbia University, Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory will operate the R/V BERNIER during 1990 as a general oceanographic vessel in support of NSF-funded research projects. The R/V BERIER is a 72.5 meter (254') general research vessel with special capabilities for geophysical research. The ship was constructed in 1983 and is currently owned by the Trustees for Columbia University in the City of New York. The recently purchased R/V BERNIER will replace the R/V CONRAD which was retired in 1989. The R/V CONRAD was successfully operated and maintained by LDGO for over ten years. The R/V BERNIER will conduct operations worldwide. This vessel is part of a fleet used by the National Science Foundation to support oceanographic research projects. Most oceanographic research projects require highly specialized equipment and extensive support from a ship's crew members. An increasing number of research projects require equipment that must be permanently installed on a ship and for which the ship must be specifically designed. Such equipment also requires highly trained crew members for maintenance and operation. These vessels do not operate in the same manner as general cargo or fishing vessels, and therefore, NSF supports the operation of a variety of vessels specifically dedicated to oceanographic research. These vessels are operated by universities and research institutions around the country.\n",
      "a9001170 CCR $104157 Adaptive IIR filters can be useful in many signal processing and communication applications. However, a number of important issues concerning their robust design needs to be resolved before they can be widely used. This research addresses some of those issues. In particular, it deals with: 1) Exhaustive study of the properties of signed adaptive IIR filters, with special emphasis on the development of design tools and guidelines to ensure their robust performance. 2) Design of adaptive IIR filters which are time varying. Both slow and fast time variations will be considered. 3) Development of formal methodologies for designing error filters for a range of adaptive algorithms. The resolution of the above issues will contribute to the basic understanding of issues linked to good adaptive filter performance and lead to the development of design tools for a spectrum of applications.\n",
      "a9001172 DEB $9000 Fruiting plants that rely on frugivorous birds for seed dispersal may experience important fitness consequences resulting from neighborhood influences on bird foraging movements. Birds respond to spatial patterns of fruit resource availability; thus these patterns will influence seed deposition patterns. Neighborhood effects on seed dispersal have not been studied. This research examines these effects on a tropical mistletoe species in pasture trees at Monteverde, Costa Rica. Neighborhood effects from the individual plant perspective, on three stages of dispersal; bird visitation, behavior during visits, and post- visitation movements, using an array of high and low density host and mistletoe neighborhoods (ca. 1 ha) will be determined. Mistletoes provide good systems for examining seed dispersal because bird deposition of seeds can be observed directly, and, as parasites, they have unique dispersal requirements. The study system provides a unique opportunity to examine these effects because of the arrangement of hosts and mistletoes at the site. The study will also enhance general knowledge of these little-studied tropical species. Disturbed habitats, such as the proposed site, are of increasing importance in the neotropics with the continuing loss of forests, and an understanding of ecological interactions in these habitats is likewise of increasing importance. Mistletoes can be serious pests in deforested areas where mostly susceptible trees are left standing; thus, this study is of both basic and applied interest.\n",

      "a9001179 DEB $8000 The abundances of many plant species fluctuate widely in natural populations. Close examination of some of the most simple mathematical models of population growth has shown that in addition to the effects of random environmental noise, fluctuations in population size (from periodic oscillations to chaos) may be part of the natural dynamics of many systems. These theoretical results are seldom tested because multi- generation experiments in controlled environments are often difficult and expensive to conduct. The investigators will use experimental populations to examine 15 generations of the population dynamics of Cardamine pennsylvanica, a small, rapidly- growing greenhouse weed. Using a greenhouse weed allows them to do experiments in ecologically \"natural\" conditions with the precision and ease of a controlled environment. Population dynamics may be affected by different environments. Hence, some experimental populations will have variable environments and others will not. Population dynamics may be affected by the genetics of the population. Hence, some experimental populations will have little genetic variability and others will have substantial genetic variability. Genetically uniform populations may be expected to evolve little, and exhibit purely ecological responses. These experiments are essential steps toward understanding to what extent populations dynamics are driven by ecological versus genetic processes.\n",

      "a9001183 BCS $8726 Historical perspective is essential in order to understand the nature of the relationship between human activity and the environment and to evaluate long-term productivity of sustainability or impact. The introduction of livestock into Mexico in the sixteenth century modified the subsistence strategies of the indigenous population as well as the pre-existing dynamic equilibrium among the population, production systems, and the environment. This doctoral dissertation research will document the development of the livestock industry in the Coixtlahuaca Basin of northwestern Oaxaca, Mexico, and it will examine that industry's impact on the way of life of the population and on the regional environment over the last 450 years. This project will combine data from field observations with information derived from archival research. The investigator will map current and past land uses and will establish and date depositional sediment and paleosol sequences along several stream channels. He will review ethnohistorical sources from which information on land uses, economic activities, community boundaries, resource availability, droughts, crop failures, diseases and populations of the area will be extracted, and he will compare these data with those of the present. Our understanding of long-term processes relating to environmental and cultural systems remains limited. This study is unusual in its effort to delineate the man-land relationship in the past and to carry the relationship through to the present. The research will contribute to the scientific basis of our understanding of human-environmental relationships. The project also will provide an excellent opportunity for a promising young scholar to continue to develop independent research skills.\n",
      "a9001186 DMS $42800 The principal investigator will attempt to broaden the scope of certain algebraic techniques of proven geometric utility. In the 1960's Daniel Quillen showed how to define homology and cohomology in many categories. These included simplicial sets, where he obtained the ordinary cohomology of topological spaces, but the categories of simplicial algebras over a field and simplicial unstable algebras over the mod-p Steenrod algebra both support an idea of cohomology that is relevant in homotopy theory. Cohomology of simplicial unstable algebras, for example, is the correct context for studying the E2 term of the Bousfield- Kan spectral sequence, an unstable Adams-type spectral sequence which has gained prominence due to the work of Haynes Miller, Jean Lannes and others. Under prior NSF grants, the principal investigator has made a successful study of the Quillen-type cohomology in various categories of algebras. The purpose of this project is to take these results and to extend and apply them. In particular, he should now be able to make an in-depth study of Barratt's desuspension spectral sequence and his \"Lie ring analyzer\" - both a source of conjecture and speculation for 30 years. Other projects include combining the Quillen-type cohomology techniques with the methods of Chris Stover to approach the homotopy groups of a wedge of two spaces, the study of a spectral sequence for computing the homotopy groups of a space of sections, and an exploration of the homology of function complexes using tools of Jean Lannes and A.K. Bousfield.\n",
      "a9001187 DMS $59600 This research is concerned with problems in abelian group theory and in the theory of modules over commutative domains. Several problems on Butler groups will be considered, as well as problems on the torsion product of groups. The principal investigator will also investigate modules over valuation domains. An in-depth study of modules over general domains will be undertaken with special emphasis on the situation when the field of quotients has projective dimension 1. This project has its roots in the theory of abelian groups. Abelian groups are algebraic objects having a commutative multiplicative operation. They arise in a number of areas of mathematics. This research has two basic thrusts. One may have implications for commutative algebra; the second involves the use of logical techniques in the study of abelian groups.\n",

Most studies of taste have involved rodents, which have aspects of physiology and behavior very different from humans, and there are few data on gustatory processing to compare human sensory capabilities with rodent physiology. This study utilizes a novel approach of chronic recording from a behaving animal to explore how activity in the cortex of a primate brain correlates to behavior. Response characteristics and functional organization of the cortex will be explored, to determine how well data from human psychophysical studies are matched by electrophysiological data. This novel approach will provide data important for chemosensory science, for comparing functional organization of gustatory cortex with other sensory cortical areas, and for further understanding how brain activity underlies perception and behavior.\n",

      "a9001220 BCS $7800 Much of the economic activity in cities located in developing nations is conducted by persons who operate informally. These people work independently or in small organizations in ways that circumvent formal government control or supervision. The share of urban populations engaged in these types of activities has grown rapidly in recent decades, leading scholars to debate whether the informal economic sector functions as a separate unit or whether it performs within a broader framework within which formal economic establishments still maintain primary power. This doctoral dissertation project will examine the form and function of informal economic activities in Quito, Ecuador, in order to describe the structure and diversity of activities and to analyze how persons engaged in informal activities interact with each other and with other individuals and institutions. Labor-force data in Ecuador's three largest cities will be analyzed to compare formal-informal economic patterns, and interviews with persons engaged in informal activities will be conducted to examine links among persons in the informal sector, the formal sector, and the government. Attention also will be given to identifying how working relations affect the economic mobility of persons engaged in informal activities. This project will provide valuable data and analyses of the operations of persons engaged in informal economic activities. Although focusing on an Ecuadorian case study, the insights from this project will be of great use to persons conducting related work elsewhere.

      "a9001224 MCB $5000 This grant will partially, support a FASEB Summer Research Conference on Cellular and Molecular Genetics to be held at Copper Mountain, Colorado from August 12-17, 1990. The major goal of this conference is to bring together an eminent group of cellular biologists, molecular biologists, neurobiologists, biochemists and geneticists to discuss multidisciplinary approaches to topics which are at the forefront of contemporary biology. The Conference is deliberately meant to encompass broader areas so that participants in diverse fields, but with common scientific goals, have an opportunity to interact. There are nine sessions spread over five days. There will be a session in the morning and evening and the afternoons would be used either to discuss new technologies or for poster presentations. The topics deal with: DNA replication, developmental biology of lower and higher eukaryotes, systems which allow understanding of cellular differentiation, regulation of transcription, oncogenesis, RNA processing, the cell cycle regulation, molecular neurobiology and human genetics. Additionally, there will be sessions dealing with techniques to generate transgenic mice, homologous recombination and physical manipulation of large genomes. In each scheduled session, the chairperson has carefully selected three or four principal speakers to introduce the general subject. The applicants are to include an abstract along with the application. The number of participants is not to exceed 150. There is extensive opportunity for discussion which will facilitate communication to promote scientific cooperation and collaboration among the participants.*** //\n",
      "a9001229 BCS $5460 The development of geographic information systems (GISs) as analytic tools has been parallelled by attempts to create media that allow people with varied skills and backgrounds to manipulate and interpret computer-based spatial data. The construction of more effective general user interfaces has been inhibited, however, by the fact that people structure and deal with geographic relationships in different ways. Language influences the ways in which people perceive spatial relationships, but little attention has been given by scholars to determining how linguistic differences affect the ways in which people use GISs. This doctoral dissertation research project will examine different ways in which English-speaking and Spanish-speaking persons describe, structure, and manage spatial relationships. An oral questionnaire dealing with common spatial relationships will be administered to persons in Spain, Ecuador, and the United States; persons in those nations also will experiment with different types of GIS user interfaces to determine if different formats are more effective for person speaking different languages. This project will provide a valuable test of different GIS user interface formats in different linguistic settings, thereby helping to identify the degree to which linguistic differences must be accommodated in the development of \"user-friendly\" GISs. The study will enhance understandings of the ways in which language helps structure individual understandings of spatial relationships, and it will provide an excellent opportunity for a promising young scholar to continue to develop independent research skills.\n",
      "a9001233 IIS $197706 This project will develop a cognitive model addressing human learning in the domain of computer programming. Building on prior research and additional psychological studies to be carried out, the comprehension of instructional text is formulated as a problem solving process in which the goal is to construct mental models of domain entities, process principles, and problem solving heuristics. New concepts introduced in these texts may be given meaning by explaining their relation to examples presented in instruction. One major goal of this project will be to model differences among learners in the self-explanation of examples. Specifically, preliminary studies show that learners differ in the way that they explain examples to themselves, and these differences have significant correlations with subsequent programming performance. Another major goal will be to study and develop a model whereby learners reflect on their problem solving and generate new strategies. Both of these areas have received little study in cognitive science. Our results should be important to the psychology of learning in complex formal domains, the acquisition and modification of knowledge in machine learning, and instructional research.\n",

The work will focus on methods for dealing with random errors in explanatory variables, and methods allowing for more random variation in response variables than is consistent with natural generalized linear models such as the binomial or Poisson. The two problems are closely related since errors in explanatory variables induce additional variation in response variables. Methods to be analyzed have been developed for non-normally distributed data and find application in radiation dose-response analyses for survivor data where there is substantial uncertainty in individual exposure estimates.\n",

      "a9001243 BCS $9794 Alluvial terrace and valley deposits are important sources of information about environmental changes, but the complex ways in which processes operate within river valleys and also in upstream and downstream areas makes interpretation of sediments difficult. Also troublesome are problems in assuring that the dating of sediments is accurate. Radiocarbon-dating methods have somewhat alleviated the latter difficulties, but comprehensive analyses of the dynamics of valley sedimentation based on more accurate chronologies have not been undertaken in many settings. This doctoral dissertation research project will develop a detailed chronology of alluvial change over the last 25,000 for the lower Colorado River valley of the Texas coastal plain. The chronology and analyses will be based on field mapping, on radiocarbon dating of important stratigraphic sections, and on reconstruction of depositional environments and sedimentary provenance for all stratigraphic units. The lower Colorado alluvial record will be compared with radiocarbon-controlled sequences from the upper Colorado River drainage basin and with records of sea-level rise and shoreline change along the Gulf of Mexico to address the relative roles of upstream, downstream, and internal factors as influences on the development of fluvial landforms in the lower Colorado valley. This project will provide valuable information about the timing and processes of landscape change in the study area. Because research methods to be used in this locale have been used elsewhere, this case study will contribute toward comparative analyses of regional landscape evolution and paleoenvironmental change. It also will provide an excellent opportunity for a promising young scholar to continue to develop independent research skills.\n",

Samples of up to about 45 nominal species will be collected from Caribbean islands, Central America, and the southeastern United States in order to examine phylogenetic and zoogeographic relationships. Results from electophoresis and mitochondrial DNA restriction site analysis will be used to construct a phylogeny for the genus. These data are to be combined with morphological information, which thus far has been inconclusive in resolving taxonomy, to examine character congruence. Zoogeographic evidence will be compared to area cladograms constructed for other monophyletic taxa (of a single ancestral origin) available in the scientific literature in order to test hypothesized vicariant events in the Caribbean region. The work will be performed at Auburn University by Charles Lydeard under the direction of Dr. Michael C. Wooten.\n",
      "a9001260 DEB $10080 Sedges are perennial herbs that resemble grasses, with long, narrow leaves and small, unisexual flowers that are mostly wind pollinated. Sedges have a worldwide distribution but are most diverse in North America and eastern Asia. They grow in a wide range of habitats, and many species are restricted to particular local environments. Sedges play important roles in wetland succession, peat development, and stabilization of slopes, and they provide food and shelter to wildlife. Despite their ecological importance, their taxonomy is in poor condition, with large numbers of species described on the basis of only a few, often unreliable morphological features. Graduate student Robert Naczi under the guidance of faculty sponsor Anton Reznicek at the University of Michigan is studying the taxonomy and evolution of sedges of the genus Carex section Griseae, a group of about 17 species native to eastern North America. Data from the study of morphology, anatomy, and chromosomes will be used to delimit coherent species, and these will be mapped against soil substrate and geographical range. Comparisons with other sedge groups will be made to hypothesize a likely phylogeny for the group, for future testing with molecular data. The results of the project should be a model investigation useful to systematists and ecologists worldwide who are interested in the biology and evolution of sedges.\n",
      "a9001262 DEB $7000 Many organisms possessing a haplodiploid genetic system are known to preferentially allocate maleness and femaleness to individual offspring in response to environmental conditions that differentially confer advantages to either sex. (A haplodiploid species is one in which individuals of one sex--usually males--are produced from unfertilized eggs, while fertilized eggs produce individuals of the opposite sex). For instance, parasitic wasps will most likely oviposit a female (fertilized) egg in a relatively large high quality prey individual since the ovipositing female stands to gain more grandoffspring through the function of large, robust daughters than through the function of large sons. In contrast, the female will probably gain more grandoffspring through the function of small sons than through small daughters and will thus most likely allocate male (unfertilized) eggs to small, low quality, hosts. Differential sex allocation of the form just described is well-studied in the parasitic wasps. However, the factors affecting sex allocation in haplodiploid herbivores are much less understood, though these herbivores are very common and quite often cause major economic damage (e.g., spider mites and sawflies). In addition, herbivory is probably a primitive state in many haplodiploid groups and an understanding of gender control will allow a better understanding of the evolution of herbivory. The proposed research will examine the relationship between sex allocation in haplodiploid herbivores and the variable quality of host-plants encountered. By examining diverse groups of haplodiploid herbivores, i.e., sawflies and spider mites, in which haplodiploidy arose independently, the investigators hope to define the evolutionary generalities that led to the success of this genetic system. A further aspect of this research is the relationship of population sex ratios to rates of population increase. By determining host-plant factors that result in the production of relatively greater proportions of females, the investigators will also begin to determine the host-plant factors responsible for periodic outbreaks of haplodiploid herbivores. In addition to survivorship, growth rate and egg production, the relative proportion of females in a population is a parameter with potentially large consequences for population growth rates. The ability to alter the sex ratio of hapodiploid herbivores through manipulation of their host plants could lead to an additional method of controlling many pests in agriculture and forestry. *** //\n",

      "a9001267 DEB $8487 This project tests the predictions of 'patch dynamics' community ecology models at the level of the whole community. It will help explain the diversity of insect communities and the evolutionary diversity of insects as a whole. 'Patch dynamics' models describe how dispersal, intra-specific aggregation, and disturbance allow competing species or predator and prey species to coexist on patchy ephemeral resources. Two specific questions will be answered: 1. Does community species diversity increase as the spatial patchiness of a resource is increased? 2. Does community diversity increase over several generations as the temporal discontinuity of the resource increases? Three experiments will manipulate laboratory-grown mushrooms as a patchy ephemeral resource for insects. The first experiment will determine the length of exposure that will give maximum insect diversity on mushrooms in the other experiments. The second experiment will compare the diversity of insects supported by a standard mass of mushrooms divided into either one, four, or sixteen patches. The third experiment will compare diversity over several generations between identical spatial arrays of mushrooms that are renewed at different temporal intervals.\n",

The first is an attempt at estimation of evapotranspiration using satellite-based techniques. Evapotranspiration in the rain forest is an important component of the hydrologic cycle, but is inadequately understood in this region. This portion of the research is a continuation of work begun under a previous award. The second objective is to investigate the characteristics of convection and compare these to environmental conditions. While this has been done extensively in North America, similar studies have been lacking in South America. Such contrasting studies are useful for understanding the important physical factors for convection on both sides of the equator.

      "a9001270 DMR $266200 Chemical Interactions and structural features of organic groups in polymer interfaces will be studied in detail by a combination of synthesis of thin-film model interface structures and application of several spectroscopic techniques. The most significant interactions of interest are weak, chemically specific bonds, particularly Bronsted acid-base interactions involving functional groups such as carboxylic acid, amide, amine, hydroxyl, ester, and ketone. Model organic/organic interfaces will be constructed that place polymer overlayers of monolayer thicknesses in contact with a planar substrate functionalized with organized arrays of polar organic groups of well-defined orientations. Polymer overlayers will be formed by equilibrium-like solution deposition. Characterization of the molecular structures and chemical interactions will be monitored primarily (but not exclusively) by infrared vibrational spectroscopy, optical spectroscopic ellipsometry, and quartz crystal microgravimmetry. The data will be quantitatively analyzed for the number of interactions between groups at the interface, the orientations and conformations of the groups and the polymer backbone units, the overall morphology of the film (density variations and topography) and the thermodynamics of the adsorption process. Conclusions will be drawn accordingly as to correlations between the initial substrate surface, polymer chain structure, and the final interfacial structures. In the long term, such work should contribute to accurate prediction of interfacial behavior and properties of adsorbed polymer films, and should provide well-defined systems for tests theory.\n",

The first is the area of probability inequalities and their statistical applications, including models of positive and negative dependence, correlation inequalities, prophet inequalities for dependent variables and certain combinatorial inequalities. The second area is that of limit theorems for graph-related, dependent random variables, with motivation from neural network models and statistics. The last area involves statistical problems in neural networks, e.g., the problem of choice of network size (dimension) allowing for both efficient learning and generalization, which appears to be related to the problem of model selection and overfitting for statistical data.\n",
      "a9001275 BCS $9123 Recent attention focused on the accelerating pace of human-induced environmental change obscures the fact that people have had profound impacts on natural systems for millennia. In the Western Hemisphere, significant changes occurred in the wake of European settlement over the last 500 years. Within central Mexico, the introduction of Spanish agricultural practices resulted in significant changes in the form and intensity of land uses. This doctoral dissertation project will examine how such changes have been recorded in the sediments of the upper Rio Laja valley. Radiocarbon dating will be used to establish an alluvial chronology of the upper Rio Laja valley; a hydrologic comparison of modern and pre-colonial rivers will be based on standard paleohydrologic techniques; rates of soil erosion will be measured in two tributary channels; and historic evidence of erosion in upland regions will be evaluated. This project will provide valuable information about the historic evolution of land-use patterns and related changes in river valley deposits. Although focusing on a specific locale in central Mexico, the study will yield broader insights into the complex ways in which human and natural systems have interacted over the last four centuries. The project also will provide an excellent opportunity for a promising young scholar to continue to develop independent research skills.\n",

      "a9001294 DEB $7520 This research will study the processes that generate overdispersed distributions of the hematophagous ectoparasite Oeciacus vicarius (Cimicidae) on it's colonial host, the cliff swallow (Hirundo pyrrhonata). The study will combine observations on the spatial and temporal pattern of parasitism with field and laboratory experiments on the movement of individual parasites. By fumigating cliff swallow nests to remove parasites and reintroducing fixed numbers of marked bugs, the study will investigate how factors such as host quality, host nest density, and conspecific density affect the dispersal activity of individual bugs. Female swallow bugs will be fed on swallow nestlings of various ages to determine the advantage of feeding on hosts of different quality. The dispersal paths of individual swallow bugs under natural conditions and laboratory arenas will be observed to see if their movements are random or conform to theories of directed dispersal on a signal gradient (kinesis). In order to understand the importance of intercolony dispersal of bugs, whole colonies will be fumigated and recolonization rates recorded. The predictions of mathematical models will then be compared, based on individual movement data to observed parasite distributions. The goal is to understand how the movement behavior of individual bugs translates into an emergent pattern of parasite infestation.\n",
      "a9001295 DMS $38290 Mixing rate problems concern the rate of convergence in distribution of a Markov process to its stationary distribution. The motivation for this research is Monte Carlo sampling from a complicated combinatorial object X. If one can construct a process with state space X and stationary distribution uniform on X, and if one can show that the process converges in distribution to that stationary distribution rather rapidly, the simulation of the process allows simulation of points nearly uniformly distributed in X. This technique can give accurate polynomial-time probabilistic approximations to problems. This research will focus first on two cases of this kind of problem. This first is generating a point at random from a convex polytope. The second is generating a random sample path of a self-avoiding random walk. Covering problems concern the time taken by a stochastic process to visit all of the collection of subsets of its state space. Typically the process is a random walk on a finite graph, and interest is in the time taken to visit all vertices. This work will concentrate on aspects of covering times other than bounds on expected values, particularly tail probabilities.\n",

      "a9001304 DEB $8000 Genetic relationships in natural populations of animals and plants are a basic issue in evolutionary biology. Traditional techniques used to study natural populations have often been found inadequate for describing the true genetic variability of populations and the genetic relationships between populations. In the proposed research, the recently developed technique of DNA fingerprinting will be used to investigate the genetic relationships between natural populations of Poecilia latipinna, a small fish occurring along the coastline of the Southeastern U.S. This fish has been partially genetically characterized using other techniques. Data suggest that populations of this species may be more genetically distinct than heretofore determined. DNA fingerprinting should reveal a greater level of differentiation between populations of this fish than has yet been demonstrated. If so, DNA fingerprinting could be a potential tool for other population genetic studies of both a basic and applied nature. If DNA fingerprinting can be shown to be a useful tool for describing natural populations, evolutionary biologists and managers of natural populations will have available to them a relatively simple technique with greater power for detecting genetic relationships than any method previously used.\n",
      "a9001307 DEB $3080 Nectar is the most common floral reward produced by angiosperms, but little is known about the effect of nectar production rate on pollination success. This investigation will focus on this relationship for the hummingbird-pollinated monacarpic plant Ipomopsis aggregata. The primary question of the study involves the overall effect of nectar production rate on fitness: 1) Do plants with higher nectar production rates have greater pollination success? Preliminary field evidence indicates that this does occur (at least for male function pollination success), so study of the causal mechanisms of this effect will be profitable. This question will answered by: 2) How does NPR affect standing crop? 3) How does standing crop affect visitation behavior? 4) How does visitation behavior affect pollination success? The study will investigate these questions with a variety of mutually reinforcing approaches, including computer simulation, observation of the effects of natural variation in NPR, and manipulative experiments in the field and aviary. Estimates of the effect of each mechanism in isolation can be combined to produce an estimate of pollination success that can be compared with benchmark values from Question 1, testing the adequacy of the mechanisms proposed. The research will increase understanding, not only of the fitness consequences of variation in NPR, but the mechanisms through which such effects may be expressed.\n",

They will study electromagnetic processes in heavy-ion nuclear reactions. The immediate goal of the research is to investigate whether bremsstrahlung radiation carries specific information about the nature of nuclear fragmentation in relativistic heavy-ion reactions. Also to be studied are the limitations of the widely used Williams-Weizacker virtual photon limit of the electromagnetic excitation process by comparing to a fully quantum mechanical treatment. The idea to use bremsstrahlung radiation is a new one so the investigation will prove to be timely and interesting. This work will bring together a team with unique experience on both sides.

      "a9001323 DEB $5061 Sugar maple is one of the most widespread and abundant deciduous forest trees in eastern North America. Populations of sugar maple continue to expand in forests in the corn belt states of the U.S., but at the same time appear to be declining in parts of the northeastern U.S. and southeastern Canada. A number of causes for this \"sugar maple decline\" have been suggested, including effects of both gaseous air pollutants (especially ozone), and acidic precipitation. Rather than acting as the proximate cause of death of individual trees, such diffuse environmental factors act by placing trees under chronic stress. Such stress-weakened trees then become more susceptible to attack by insect pests or diseases which actually kill the tree. In this study, the investigators will examine the effects of ambient ozone, and of slightly elevated ozone, on a number of important, basic physiological processes in sugar maple: photosynthesis, respiration, transport of sugars among plant parts, and accumulation of starch stores for overwintering. They hypothesize that ozone injury to leaves will reduce the photosynthetic rate and force the plant to use more of the energy it does obtain through photosynthesis to repair damage. In addition, they hypothesize that the system the plant uses to transport sugars from leaves to roots may be directly damaged by ozone. These changes will have the effect of reducing the amount of food (as starch and sugar) that the plant can accumulate for survival over the winter. Thus, they expect overwinter mortality to increase, and growth during the subsequent spring to be lower, in plants exposed to ozone. The investigators will also extend these experiments to screen individuals from populations in areas of sugar maple decline and unaffected areas to determine if sensitivity to ozone varies geographically. The results of these experiments may reveal much about the basic ecophysiology of sugar maple, and will also allow insight into the more applied problem of sugar maple decline.\n",

Even within a species, physical and mechanical defenses differ depending on environment, historical factors and genetic composition. Variation in plant defenses will be examined to determine the causes of variability, and subsequently, the costs to the plant of an investment in defense. The significance of this work lies in relating the natural variation in plant properties to a selective force, herbivory, and determining the effect on plant productivity. This work is central to understanding plant-herbivore interactions.\n",
      "a9001332 CHE $119200 Professor Luther Erickson and other members of the Chemistry Department of Grinnell College are being supported to conduct a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry. For the period 1990-92, ten (10) undergraduate students will spend ten (10) weeks each summer actively engaged in a variety of research projects. Projects range from molecular orbital calculations on transition metal hydrides to investigation of the diffusion of analytes in solid polymers. Students will be expected to write a project proposal, carry out supervised experimental work, present a seminar on the proposal and a second seminar on the results, and write a detailed final report.\n",
      "a9001333 EID $41260 This REU site involves a twelve-week summer research program for senior undergraduates. Nine faculty will participate in the program, with research interests in biotechnology electrochemistry, interfacial phenomena, statistical thermodynamics, polymer characterization and materials science. The program will include a tutorial series on statistics, computer programming and experimental methods for analysis. A seminar series will use the resources in other departments on campus and neighboring institutions as well as researchers from local industrial and public laboratories. In this manner, the collaborative possibilities in cross-disciplinary research open to chemical engineers and the research opportunities which exist outside the university will be made known to the student. The program will conclude with a day of public seminars, where the students will present their research activity and accomplishments.\n",
      "a9001334 EID $48527 Continued funding for an ongoing undergraduate research program that for five years has been training electrical engineering and computer science students during the summers before their senior years is sought. Students will be recruited from a variety of other schools, including primarily undergraduate institutions. The research environment will be enriched by additional undergraduate students funded from other sources. Each participant will have regular meetings with an individual faculty mentor to plan work and review progress throughout the eleven week program. Project topics in electrophysics will include artificial plasmas, microwave propagation. microstrip antennas, frequency doubling in lasers, picosecond opto- electronics, and thin film devices. Information systems topics will include image communication, multi-variable feedback control, continuous phase modulation digital signalling, LAN simulation tools, and robotics. All will benefit from extensive interactions with participating faculty and graduate students. Participants will have informative tours of our research laboratories. There will be two or three seminar presentations to the group by leaders from industry, universities or government agencies. A tour will be arranged at a nearby industrial lab or national laboratory. The program will terminate with a two-day research review during which each student will make a presentation and answer abstract of his report. A prize will be awarded to the best project.\n",

Approaches include the use of both light and microwave radiation. The cross-correlation of fluctuations in intensity will be measured as a function of separation between two points. The physical systems which are employed in the experiments consist of metallic or high-index dielectric spheres imbedded in a transparant medium. Measurements will be made in the diffusive, critical, and localized regimes.\n",
      "a9001336 INT $35612 The primary objective of this U.S.-Hungary research project between Dr. Leon Chua of the University of California, Berkeley, and Dr. Tamas Roska of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences' Computer and Automation Research Institute is to investigate mixed-mode nonlinear computing structures. Efforts will include three areas of emphasis: 1) determining the qualitative relationships between analog and digital realizations of canonical nonlinear information processing architectures; 2) simulating the quantitative problems of nonlinear programming circuits and cellular neural networks; and 3) furthering functional design of a mixed-mode nonlinear processing element to exploit analog dynamics and logical decisions. Results are expected to extend nonlinear circuit theory and may lead to a better undertanding of the operational limits of existing digitally-realized networks and new nonlinear analog and mixed-mode computing. This project in computer science fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.\n",
      "a9001339 DEB $8375 Graduate student Jose Villasenor under the guidance of Dr. Tom Elias of Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden is studying the Mexican and Guatemalan species of Senecio section Mulgedifolii, a poorly known group of tropical montane sunflower relatives. He plans a broad survey of features of morphology, chromosome composition, and analysis of variation in chloroplast DNA. The goals include evaluation of morphological characters that provide stable, reliable guides to the identification of species; mapping of the geographic distributions of the estimated 15 or so species throughout Mesoamerica; and inference of the evolutionary relationships among these species and with closely related groups of Senecio. Villasenor has published a number of papers on the plant resources of Mexico, and has conducted field work in several regions of the country. The broad approach he is taking to the study of plant biodiversity, encompassing both traditional morphological investigation and laboratory analysis of genetic and genomic variation, will bring increased understanding of tropical plant resources in the Americas, and in turn the research will contribute to training of the next generation of plant scientists.\n",
      "a9001341 DEB $6054 The goals of this dissertation research project to be performed by Steven O. Shattuck and Professor Philip S. Ward of the University of California at Davis are to define genera within the ant sub-family Dolichoderinae (about 1000 species worldwide, in 31 genera) and attempt to demonstrate their monophyly (having one ancestral origin) based on morphological traits of workers, queens, males, and larvae. Other goals are to analyze cladistic relationships among these groups using rigorous methods of phylogenetic inference, develop a key to all known genera based on the above-mentioned character analysis, and compile a species- level catalog of all taxa (including information on current generic status, type locality, and if available, location and number of type specimens). Preserved material at existing museum collections in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom will be examined for characters suitable for cladistic analysis. Hypotheses about relationships among genera will be evaluated by examining congruence between worker, queen, and male ant data sets and by statistical estimation of cladogram confidence limits. Results will identify natural units for alpha-taxonomic studies, provide a foundation for species-level phylogenetic investigations by elucidating sister-group relationships among genera, and assist in access to the taxonomic literature on the Dolichoderinae.\n",
      "a9001343 BCS $9290 Recent studies have been undertaken at sites scattered throughout the world to analyze pollen and sediments in cores from bogs, lakes, and other appropriate settings. These analyses have shed considerable light on changing patterns of vegetation and climate over the last 10,000 and more years. One area that has not been intensively studied, however, is the humid, subtropical region of southeastern China. This doctoral dissertation project will extract and analyze cores from bogs in the Wuyi and Daiyun mountains of Fujian Province. Radiocarbon dating will help establish the ages of pollen and sediments within the cores, and related analyses will help reconstruct vegetational and climatic patterns in the region. This project will provide valuable information for reconstructing the natural environmental history of southeastern China. This reconstruction will be especially useful because it will help assess the impacts of changing conditions on monsoon circulation, which is such an important facet of the region's climate. This project also will provide an excellent opportunity for a promising young scholar to continue to develop independent research skills.\n",
      "a9001344 DMS $45990 Professor Casazza will conduct research on several problems in the theory of Banach spaces. They involve (i) uniqueness of unconditional and symmetric structures in finite dimensional spaces, (ii) various forms of the Approximation Property, and (iii) the existence of prime Banach spaces. This award will support research in the geometry of Banach spaces. In finite dimensions, all vector spaces are essentially the same. But in the infinite dimensional situation primarily of interest here, this is far from the case. Banach spaces are infinite dimensional spaces with the additional structure introduced by varying notions of distance between points in the space. Such spaces have wide application in mathematics, both pure and applied.\n",
      "a9001345 DEB $10946 The life cycle of freshwater unionid mussels is atypical among bivalves and involves both a free-living adult and a parasitic larva, the glochidium. Following fertilization, developing embryos are incubated in the water tubes of the mother's gills where they may remain for several months before being released into the water column and becoming parasitic on fish. The principal objective of this study is to assess the morphological and physiological changes that occur within the gills of brooding female Anodonta cataracta, an abundant freshwater mussel in North Carolina. During brooding, two of the mussel's four gills become packed with nearly a million glochidia, causing the gills to swell to up to thirty times their non-brooding size. The major goals of the proposed research include quantifying the morphological changes that occur within the marsupial gills, comparing the pumping and filtration dynamics of brooding and non-brooding mussels, determining the effect of brooding on oxygen uptake and oxygen extraction efficiency of mussels, and assessing the activity of the cilia responsible for irrigation both the marsupial and non-marsupial gills. The results will provide a more complete understanding of the reproductive biology of A. cataracta, especially the effect of glochidial brooding and release on the physiology and gill morphology of adult females. This information also may have application for the management and conservation of other freshwater bivalves including threatened and endangered species.\n",

      "a9001353 INT $0 This award will support Professor Richard D. Gonzalez of the University of Illinois at Chicago Circle in collaboration with Professor Ricardo Gomez of the Metropolitan University of Mexico at Iztapalapa. Studies recently completed suggest that metal-precursor-support interactions are important in determining the resulting surface composition of supported multimetallic catalysts. In particular, the presence of a mobile surface metal-precursor results in the surface enrichment of that metal in the resulting bimetallic catalyst. The investigators aim to identify the structure of these precursor-surface complexes using diffuse U.V. reflectance spectroscopy. The strength of the metal-support interactions will be measured through the use of quantitative differential scanning calorimetry and the elemental composition of the resulting bimetallic particles will be obtained through the use of dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDXS). EDXS will also be used to study interparticle metal phase relationships. The proposed research will be carried out simultaneously at the University of Illinois at Chicago and the Metropolitan University of Mexico at Iztapalapa. The in-situ diffuse U.V. reflectance studies, the microcalorimetric DSC studies and the catalyst charac- terization studies, including the surface composition measurements, will be carried out at the University of Illinois. The catalytic probe reactions and major portion of the EDXS studies will be performed in Mexico.\n",

Very little is known about the capabilities of vegetative cells to synthesize and secrete proteins. The modified expression systems could serve as a basis for new recombinant DNA technology for efficient production of commercially important Bacillus exoenzymes and heterologous foreign proteins.\n",
      "a9001357 DMS $42600 This award supports the research in arithmetic algebraic geometry of Professor Alice Silverberg of The Ohio State University. Dr. Silverberg's project is to study arithmetic quotients of bounded symmetric domains and their points, and especially certain special group representations associated to such points. This is research in the field of arithmetic algebraic geometry, a subject that combines the techniques of algebraic geometry and number theory. In its original formulation, algebraic geometry treated figures that could be defined in the plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Number theory started with the whole numbers and such questions as divisibility of one whole number by another. These two subjects, seemingly so far apart, have in fact influenced each other from the earliest times, but in the past quarter century the mutual influence has increased greatly. The field of arithmetic algebraic geometry now uses techniques from all of modern mathematics, and is having corresponding influence beyond its own borders.\n",
      "a9001360 AST $21074 This award will allow the Principal Investigator to upgrade the positioning and guidance system of the Southwest Missouri State University (SMSU) Baker Observatory 0.4-m Cassegrain reflecting telescope. This telescope was one of the first instruments used at Kitt Peak National Observatory (KPNO) and Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory (CTIO). It was obtained from CTIO by SMSU in 1983 on a long-term, renewable loan basis. The telescope was installed at Baker Observatory in 1984, and although the optical system is still quite satisfactory, the positioning and guidance system is in need of modernization. This award provides funds to purchase a computer-controlled closed-loop stepping motor positioning system and a remote guiding system. These will allow rapid and accurate positioning and precise guiding of the telescope. This will permit efficient use with existing instrumentation, which consists of an automated-filter photometer and a CCD imaging system. The scientific programs to be carried out with these instruments include high precision photoelectric and CCD camera photometry of variable stars, standard stars, and bright galaxies.\n",
      "a9001362 CHE $154000 In this project in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Hall will develop new mathematical models for the study of clusters of metals such as sodium. This will eventually lead to more complex investigations of disordered condensed phases. The path integral formulation of quantum mechanics will be used to study sodium metal clusters, the elctron gas, and as a means for determining the Mott transition in sodium. The long term goal of this research is to develop methods that are capable of determining correlated electron properties in disordered condensed phase systems. The studies of sodium metal clusters will focus on determining the extent of electron delocalization as a function of cluster size. The electron gas and bulk sodium calculations will investigate aspects of the insulator-metal transition.\n",
      "a9001365 DMS $83210 This project continues mathematical research centering on topics in the theory of several complex variables. The work involves studies of complex manifolds, representing the geometric point of view, together with analytic investigations into value distributions and continuity properties of complex functions. One primary focus concerns what is known as the Hartogs phenomenon whereby a holomorphic function of several variables defined in a region surrounding a domain (such as in a complex annulus) continues as a holomorphic function to the inner region. Work will be done in extending the idea in two directions. The first is to determine the extent to which a separate analyticity implies joint, while the second is concerned with the Hartogs phenomenon as it relates to mapping into complex manifolds. Although many manifolds reflect this property, some do not. The outstanding problem remains one of giving conditions on the target manifolds so that the extension property holds for all mappings into the manifold. Value distribution theory is concerned with the extent to which holomorphic functions defined in the space of several complex variables can omit or assume given values. The measurement of such affinities involves generalizations of the classical Nevanlinna theory which was developed for functions of a single variable during the first decades of this century. For nonconstant functions, their affinity for any value is almost always the same as for any other. The exceptions represent the deficiencies of the function - the measure of the set of deficiencies will be of primary concern during this investigation.\n",
      "a9001371 ECS $190000 This project describes a basic research program focused on the design and analysis of robust and H- infinity optimal feedback systems. This research program has four major components: multivariable robust stability and stabilization problems, H-infinity optimal control of finite and infinite-dimensional systems, analysis and design of nonlinear time- varying controllers for robust control of linear time- invariant systems, controller design for multiple performance functionals. To account for possible uncertainties in system models, both parametric and unstructured uncertainty in plant models will be considered. Optimal design in the H-infinity norm is considered to provide robustness against uncertainty in the spectra of the exogenous signals or unstructured dynamic modeling uncertainty. It is also a key step in design for robust performance in the presence of unstructured uncertainty. The emphasis is on the development of computationally efficient algorithms for controller design. For this purpose, all high-level algorithms will be developed in terms state-space realizations, real or complex matrix algebraic equations, etc. It is expected that most of the algorithms will be implementable on a variety of computers ranging from engineering workstations to mainframe computers.\n",
      "a9001372 DMS $67700 This award supports the research in Diophantine approximations of Professor Paul Vojta of the University of California at Berkeley. Dr. Vojta's project is to extend his already-productive analogy between Nevanlinna Theory and Diophantine approximation theory, so as to get information on algebraic points of bounded degree on varieties. In addition, he hopes to generalize to varieties of higher dimension his independent proof of the Mordell-Faltings Theorem that arose from applying his viewpoint to Dyson's sharpening of the Thue-Siegel Theorem. This is research in the field of arithmetic algebraic geometry, a subject that combines the techniques of algebraic geometry and number theory. In its original formulation, algebraic geometry treated figures that could be defined in the plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials.

      "a9001375 DEB $77577 The mimosa group of tropical legumes are woody plants that range in stature from small prickly shrubs of Mexican and Argentine deserts or Caribbean coral reef-shores to gigantic emergent forest trees of Brazilian Amazonia. They enter all woodland shrub communities of the Neotropics below about 2000 meters elevation, and are an almost ubiquitous element in the flora of forest margins. Numbered among them are the stately saman (Albizia saman), which fills in urban Latin America the role of the banyan in India, and in rural Latin America provides shade and a crop of nutritious fruits for cattle; and the guamuchil (Pithecellobium dulce), a staple of rural markets, the seeds of which are enveloped in sweet pulp esteemed as a fruit and as basis for summer drinks. Most of them, however, are appreciated primarily by local people, for whom they provide nursery shade trees in the coffee orchards, timber used in construction, furniture, and as fuel, and are a rich source of honey. In these roles the mimosas of the Americas have acquired a large vocabulary of vernacular names, both in Amerindian and Latin languages, testifying to their importance in the lives of the people who use them. The last comprehensive taxonomic inventory of the mimosa group dates back to 1875. Since then much has been learned about them, and many new species have been discovered and described. Most of these exist, so far as retrievable information goes, only as names in obscure technical publications, and no one can say for sure how many are truly distinct species, or where they are to be found, or how they should be named according to current rules of botanical nomenclature. There is no modern inventory other than the patchwork of accounts that have appeared in floras of political units, many of which are mutually contradictory, one species appearing under different names in different countries, and several distinct species often masquerading under one name. Without a reliable inventory, no rational decisions can be made about the management, exploitation, or conservation of woody floras on which the function of ecological systems and the prosperity of mankind depend. Drs. Rupert Barneby and James Grimes of the New York Botanical Garden are providing this modern inventory, for the woody tropical legumes of the large genus Pithecellobium and its relatives. The results will serve as a source of verified information on which the writers and users of floras can depend, for practical identification of species, for correct scientific nomenclature, for indication of geographical ranges and habitat occurrences, and for documentation of economic uses by local peoples.\n",
      "a9001376 AST $187156 Dr. Beers will complete an objective prism survey of the northern and southern hemispheres of our Galaxy and then follow up on selected stars which have extremely low metal abundances and stars on the horizontal branch of their evolutionary track. The final database of candidates should include about 16,000 stars with relatively low abundances of iron, and about 25,000 horizontal branch stars will be identified. The halo of our Galaxy contains less than 1 percent of the luminous stars in the entire Galaxy. Yet the halo is fundamental for revealing crucial issues of stellar evolution, the processes of galaxy formation and evolution, and for constraining the distribution of matter throughout the Galaxy. To understand the halo, one must first find it and characterize it. Ideally, complete spectroscopic and photometric information for the approximately one billion luminous stars which populate the halo would allow the observer to draw a picture of the halo which is untainted by sampling bias. Short of this, one can only attempt to minimize the effects of any selection criteria which must be imposed to make the problem tractable. In its broadest sense, the purpose of Dr. Beers' survey is to discover the objects which will, eventually, allow for a much more complete understanding of the halo of our Galaxy.\n",
      "a9001378 DMR $1284300 A new Materials Research Group will investigate microstructure in polycrystalline materials. The objective is to study, in real time, the evolution of thermo-mechanical processing events, and their impact on the mechanical, electrical, and elastic properties of engineering materials. The work will exploit recent advances in electron diffraction techniques (backscatter Kikuchi diffraction) which will enable automated measurements of a new class of microstructural measures of texture in polycrystalline materials. These microtextures are believed to affect a wide range of material properties and performance. The scope of activity will involve an inter-disciplinary, multi- collaborator group, centered at Yale University, with additional group members at Drexel University, The University of Bristol (England), and NIST (Boulder). The research involves both theoretical and experimental aspects of texture analysis. The project should result in development of a timely and necessary new generation of tools required to address fundamental topics which have great potential for application in materials processing occurring in both the primary and advanced metals industries.\n",
      "a9001381 CHE $416056 The Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr. Kevin M. Smith of the Department of Chemistry at the University of California-Davis. Professor Smith is engaged in a broad-based and wide-ranging study of the synthesis, biosynthesis, chemistry, and spectroscopy of chlorophylls and bacteriochlorophylls. Chlorophylls are the catalysts in the vital process of photosynthesis and are involved in light gathering (antenna systems) as well as in the process of charge separation (in the reaction center). Current work focuses on the investigation of the chemical and biochemical basis for the methylation of bacteriochlorophyll-c and -d pigments which causes shifts in the cell absorption maxima, enabling the bacterium to adapt to conditions of low light. Esterifying alcohols on bacteriochlorophylls-c and -d molecules will be correlated with age of culture and extent of alkylation. Biosynthetic studies will also be undertaken; these involve biosynthesis of bacteriochlorophylls-c and -d, using isotopically enriched (carbon-13 and carbon-14) precursors to determine the branchpoint from chlorophyll-a biosynthesis and the latter stages in bacteriochlorophyll-a biosynthesis. A chemical synthesis of chlorophyll-a and its 4-vinyl analog, conversion of the former into the latter, and a biomimetic ring-cleavage of chlorophyll derivatives for chemical synthesis of certain photochemically active active bilins (e.g. phytochrome, which regulates plant growth and development) will be studied. Finally, chiral chlorophyll derivatives will facilitate synthesis of chiral N-alkylporphyrin ferrochelatase inhibitors, and chemical and electrochemical cyclizations of tetrapyrroles to give porphyrins will be investigated.\n",

      "a9001391 DEB $7000 Tiger swallowtails use a number of plant species that vary in their chemical composition. These host species differ in their attractiveness to egg-laying females and their suitability for caterpillar growth. In addition, genetically different individuals show dissimilar responses on identical host plants. Potentially, the differential ability of swallowtails to recognize or grow on different plant species serves to maintain much of the genetic variation observed in natural swallowtail populations. Although selection tends to eliminate certain genotypes on certain hosts, it tends to increase their frequency on other hosts. The proposed research is designed to assess the genetic basis for the physiological and behavioral patterns of host plant usage by the tiger swallowtail. The investigators hypothesize that this subspecies is comprised of a complex of differentially adapted genotypes and populations. Experiments will compare the responses of three geographic populations and families within populations on three different host plants. Complementary analyses will determine the genetic substructure of these populations. Information obtained from these laboratory and field studies will elucidate the role of host diversity in maintaining genetic variability among and within populations of a single species. Such knowledge will help in understanding how insects adapt to their food sources and will prove useful in developing pest management programs for commercially important crop species.\n",

They will investigate group actions on generalized trees, extending research of Culler- Vogtmann and Gillet-Shalen. They will also apply the theory of character varieties to the study of Heegaard splittings of non- Haken 3-manifolds. Culler will continue his work on cohomological properties of the outer automorphism group of the free group. Shalen will study questions about amalgamated free product decompositions and deficiencies of subgroups, both in 3-manifold groups and in more general finitely presented groups. He will also investigate possible generalizations of Casson's invariant and connections with SL(2,C) representations of 3-manifold groups. These are all very active topics in the topology of 3- dimensional manifolds, i.e. very natural geometric objects of the same dimension as the space in which we live.\n",

The eventual goals of the project are: 1) to create quantitative descriptions (using a mathematical model or models) of the types of transport and reaction distribution occurring during early diagenesis, and 2) to understand better the implications of the transports and distributions on the geochemistry and ecology of the sediments.\n",
      "a9001398 DBI $124608 This award provides support to The University of Minnesota to continue the summer program of undergraduate research experiences in the behavioral sciences established in 1987. The ten-week program emphasizes student participation in the research activities of faculty affiliated with the Center of Liberal Arts. Eleven undergraduates will participate, two-thirds from private liberal arts colleges in the state of Minnesota and one-third from the University; they will be expected to have completed their junior year. Student's will: (1) assist with a faculty member's research including opportunities to work as a member of a research team, (2) complete a research project, the final product of which will be a written report and a presentation to peers and participating faculty, and (3) participate in a multidisciplinary seminar. Seminar activities include presentations by program faculty and faculty in related areas campus wide, laboratory tours, and lectures on research tools and design. The program will therefore include opportunities for the students to learn specific research methods, to apply these methods in the context of their own research, and to examine broad conceptual and methodological issues relating to psychology and the cognitive sciences. Participation in social/cultural events as well as common housing in a University dorm will help foster a strong community of students.\n",
      "a9001399 SES $194661 This award extends for one year the American Statistical Association project entitled \"On- Site Research Program to Improve the Quality of Labor Statistics\". The plan for subsequent years is to effect a merger with similar on- site research programs conducted at the Bureau of Census and the National Center for Education Statistics. The program, which was initiated at the Bureau of Labor Statistics in 1987, brings senior research fellows and associates to the Bureau for periods of up to one year. Its broadbased goal is to help bridge the gap between academic scholars and governmental scientists by exposing the fellows and associates to the methodological problems and policy issues likely to be encountered only in a large scale Federal statistical agency and by exposing government social scientists to new theoretical developments which might have application to their work. Residence at the Bureau allows fellows and associates to carry out research that would be difficult if not impossible to do without the ready access to the data resources of the Bureau of Labor Statistics which the program provides.\n",

The investigator wishes to extend the theory in two directions: firstly, to subsets of the d dimensional lattice and random walks on this lattice; and secondly, to the study of the sample paths of measure valued diffusions. Since recent developments in physics in which ideas involving fractals and their dimension play a prominent role, the work could have important implications for physicists.\n",
      "a9001402 DMS $49423 With this award the principal investigator will continue his application of asymptotic methods of singular perturbation type to the study of bifurcation problems and moving boundary problems that arise from reaction-diffusion systems. In particular, he will investigate so-called singular bifurcation problems, wherein small changes in the bifurcation parameter can cause large responses in the system, laser instabilities, and the changing time history of the moving interface in certain pharmaceutical problems involving the time-release of medication. This proposal is concerned with bifurcation phenomena. As an illustration, stand a plastic ruler on its end and push on the top end. If you do not push very hard nothing happens. But if you push sufficiently hard the first thing that happens is that the ruler bows, either to the left or to the right. We call this a bifurcation: the configuration of the straight ruler has split (bifurcated) into one of two possible shapes. Applying still more force to the ruler results in an even number of bowed shapes having more and more curves. The principal investigator will study the number of solutions that bifurcate from a given solution of systems of equations that govern lasers and release of chemicals in the body.\n",
      "a9001404 DMS $115500 With this award the principal investigator will continue his modelling of elliptical galactic systems and the analytical solution of the model problems. In particular, he will construct self-consistent models of elliptical galaxies by means of Staeckel potentials. The main reasons for using Staeckel potentials are that they allow the same major orbit families as those found from numerical simulations of realistic galactic models and they lead to mathematically tractable problems. The aspect of astronomy that most of us are familiar with involves the use of telescopes to make observations of stars and galaxies. Another aspect that is less well known involves the construction of mathematical models of celestial objects in order to gain a greater understanding of the physics of stellar systems. This research involves the construction and analysis of a model for elliptical galaxies by means of a potential that describes an interacting system of many bodies.\n",

One theme concerns what are now called Fatou theorems for classes of nonlinear elliptic equations, including the important p-Laplacian. The object is to determine, for nonnegative solutions, the extent to which the solution has nontangential boundary values. A primary goal is to obtain basic estimates on solutions which depend on the shape of the boundary but do not depend on the smoothness of the coefficients in the equation. In the same spirit, work will also be done investigating existence questions for second order elliptic systems and higher order elliptic operators defined in nonsmooth domains. By this, one usually means domains which occur in the physical world, but which do not have very smooth boundaries. Corners and edges are allowed for example. It is only in the last decade that any major progress has been made toward understanding the extent to which one may establish a good existence and regularity theory. In the preceding, the major results obtained used techniques of classical double layer potential theory mixed with modern operator theory. Work will continue on the operators developed for the above purposes. The focus here will be to analyze the spectrum of the operators and read from it information about the operators. The spectrum is known to consist of real numbers for classical operators and the conjecture to be studied is that it lies in a symmetric interval of length one-half about the origin. Finally, work will be done on the Dirichlet problem for second order nondivergence form elliptic operators. Although a highly developed theory for such operators has existed since the early 1950's, there has always been a standing assumption that the coefficients of the operator be smooth. This work breaks with that tradition in seeking to define what one would mean by a reasonable solution when the operator is formed from merely bounded coefficients. Even though one must expect solutions with discontinuities and distributional derivatives, the potential for application of this work is very high.\n",

Professor Warner will study interactions between cyclodextrans with a series of polyaromatic hydrocarbons using a suite of spectroscopic methods. This research will use infrared spectroscopy, circular dichroism spectroscopy, x-ray crystallography and fluorescence spectroscopy to elucidate the molecule details of complexation between cyclodextrans and polyaromatic hydrocarbons together with the ternary effects arising from addition of alcohols. The results from this research will be useful in developing analytical measurements for naturally chiral compounds and for compounds with induced chirality.\n",

      "a9001421 DMS $46550 The research in mathematical statistics is divided into three parts: testing for overdispersion in discrete distributions, testing that a sample comes from a normal distribution rather than a finite mixture of normal distributions, and semi-parametric estimation of a mixed normal density. A new test will be constructed for the presence of a mixture. Also a new test and diagnostic for the number of components in a mixture will be derived. This will be achieved by exploiting the geometry of ratios of mixed and unmixed densities. A further goal is to estimate the mixed normal density using an approach in which a smoothing parameter is selected via cross- validation.\n",
      "a9001425 BES $197301 Experimental studies at the organ and single vessel level suggest that hemodynamic factors play a role in angiogenesis; however, the proposed factors have not been proven to work in microvascular networks. This proposal focuses on the hypothesis that the development of mature microvascular network from the primitive neonatal vascular plexus (the process of network remodeling) is the result of gradual adaptation of vessels to local mechanical forces, such as, shear stress exerted by blood flow on the vessel wall and intravascular pressure. To test the hypothesis in cerebral tissue, experiments will be performed to study changes in intracortical and pial microvascular architecture and vascular dimensions in two to five week old rats, and to correlate some of these changes with wall shear stress, intravascular pressure and other hemodynamic variables. Subsequently, a mathematical model will be developed to test whether the architecture of intracortical microvascular networks can be predicted from the microvascular architecture of the neonate and certain properties of vascular adaptation learned from the experiments. These studies will provide important new information on the role of hemodynamic factors in the development of the cerebral microvascular bed which may influence growth and repair of cerebral tissue.\n",
      "a9001426 AST $77000 Interstellar Scattering Disks. Dr. Gwinn will carry out a radio wavelength observational study of the shapes of scattering disks in the interstellar medium and of their temporal variations. The observations include Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) measurements of the sizes of the scattering disks of pulsars over periods of years; sensitive VLBI observations of the scattering disks of hydroxyl masers; and a search for speckles in the scattering disk of the Vela pulsar. Radio wavelength scattering in the interstellar plasma limits the resolution and positional accuracy of observations of many radio sources and will become more important as a limit as VLBI baselines are extended into space and the accuracy of astrometric VLBI approaches the microarcsecond level. Large scale plasma fluctuations, acting as lenses, can focus and defocus radiation from pulsars and quasars, producing the observed low frequency variability of these sources. Dr. Gwinn's research is directed toward improving our understanding of the properties of the scattering plasma.\n",

      "a9001434 ATM $78400 During the past few decades observed increases in atmospheric concentrations of certain trace species (eg. CO2, O3, CH4, etc.) have resulted in a growing awareness of man's potential to perturb his environment on a global scale. Consequently, this decade has seen increased efforts to identify and understand the properties of the remote atmosphere and the processes relating the sources, transformations and removal of the constituents that are present. This kind of investigation involves measurement of the particle and gas phase species of interest in conjunction with the environmental and meteorological parameters known to influence their behavior. Understanding these processes is essential to assessing the importance of various issues of current environmental concern. These include 1) the role of clouds on climate, 2) the role of aerosol and gases in atmospheric radiative transfer and 3) the geochemical cycling of atmospheric constituents. Any investigation of these issues requires a knowledge of the relative influence of anthropogenic, \"natural\" continental and marine contributions. This research project will support the analysis of data collected from: 1) the recent Central Pacific Atmospheric Comparison Experiment (CPACE) aboard the NCAR-Electra aircraft was intended to intercompare and evaluate recently developed techniques for measuring gas and aerosol species at low concentrations. Size-resolved aerosol information will be combined with the measurements of other CPACE investigators for the characterization of our atmospheric observations and to complete the proposed evaluation of aerosol inlet losses; and 2) measurements of aerosol physicochemistry and optical properties during five equatorial transects currently obtained as part of the Soviet-American Gas and Aerosol Experiment Three (SAGA III) the equatorial Pacific between Hawaii and Samoa in spring of 1990.\n",

      "a9001442 CHE $288985 This research is being funded by the Organic Synthesis Chemistry Program. Dr. Hendrickson is developing a computer based system to aid in the complicated process of synthesizing the variety of structures that are found in nature or the new molecules needed to meet the demands of our society. The computer provides an important tool in making choices among the myriad possible routes to synthesize new structures in an efficient and economic manner. The first version of a computer program (SYNGEN) was developed which creates the shortest synthesis routes of construction reactions only by a protocol based on convergent assembly of the target molecule from real starting materials in a catalog. The program proceeds without resort to a database library of reactions and without operator intervention. The program will be developed into a fully practical tool for organic chemists, refining the presentation to present the best routes foremost and to offer literature precedents on command. Ancillary developments will include several new strategies for synthesis design and expanded capabilities into special chemistry. The reaction and starting material bases available for synthesis will be organized and used to assess the nature of existing syntheses in the literature to gain more insight into the logic of design strategies in actual use.\n",
      "a9001446 ATM $170000 Space science has long sought the answer to the cause for different types of auroral structures and their occurrence at different times within the global magnetic activity. The research scientists in this program have in the past attempted to trace the effects of currents from the ionosphere near quiet time auroral structures into the magnetosphere using quiet time magnetic field models. This new project will use a more disturbed model of the magnetosphere to investigate more dynamic structures associated with the auroral substorm, such as auroral loops, poleward surges and omega bands. In addition, this new model will allow study of mapping effects produced by the diversion of cross-tail current to the ionosphere. These studies of the coupling between electron and ion currents in the inner magnetotail may help to unravel some of the physical processes that take place during the auroral substorm onset.\n",

      "a9001458 SES $57510 Over the last decade statistical data and inference have played an important role in establishing the basic facts used for public policy, e.g.estimating the prevalence of AIDS or HIV infection, determining the risk of cancer from occupational or environmental exposures, assessing changes in the income distribution and in the legal setting, e.g. tax assessment inequality. The purpose of this project is to study statistical problems arising in these contexts and to develop appropriate probability models and statistical methodology for their solution. Research on procedures for estimating the prevalence of a rare disease which preserve anonymity by combining individual samples into batches prior to testing is a major goal. These methods should enable health specialists to obtain the cooperation of the public as infected individuals and non- infected persons who are misclassified (false positive) will not be identified. Robust methods which lead to statistically valid inferences when several scientifically plausible models may underlie the data or when a few observations may be erroneous will continue to be emphasized. Recent legal decisions in the equal employment area have raised new questions concerning the measurement of discrimination. It is planned to investigate the statistical approaches used in Watson v. Fort Worth Bank and to examine the implications of the Ward's Cove case for more refined data and methods of analysis. Related problems arising in legal and economic applications, e.g. the analysis of group data, also will be investigated.\n",

Some of the results from this study will lead to new insights concerning the design of new materials for solid state applications. This study of \"Cyclic and Polycyclic Organostannanes\" will bridge the curent gap in knowledge concerning the structure, bonding, and physical properties of cyclic and polycyclic compounds of tin. The nature of bonding available to Group 14 elements within ring-strained systems, the development of new synthetic methodology which will facilitate the construction of a desired cyclic or polycyclic organostannane framework, the refinement of structure/bonding/physical property relationships for tin, and the development of new spectroscopic techniques such as Sn-119 NMR, electrochemistry, and electron spin resonance (ESR) for investigating the molecular and electronic structure of cyclic and polycyclic organostannanes are being studied\n",
      "a9001463 DMS $73500 Professor Buechler's research in mathematical logic is in stability theory, a subfield of model theory. In recent years several general model-theoretic problems have been systematically approached via the stability hierarchy. Even though the problem itself may not involve stability-theoretic notions, considering separately the cases: omega-stable, superstable, etc., brings into play a mass of technical machinery. Such is the case for Vaught's conjecture, which was proved by Shelah for omega-stable theories. The next step is to consider all superstable theories, but this has proved too difficult for the methods used in the omega-stable case. What is required is an analysis which is sensitive to the way in which, e.g., sets of rank alpha are pieced together to form sets of rank alpha plus one. Buechler will continue with this geometrical approach to the problem, which has already yielded significant results.\n",

Because the Wets Spitsbergen Current). Because the West Spitsbergen Current is the primary importer of ocean heat to the High Arctic, and is responsible for maintaining the sea-ice free conditions in the Norwegian Sea, detailed knowledge of the history of this current is critical to a complete understanding of the transition form the last glaciation to the present warm, interglacial climate state. Thermohaline processes on the broad Arctic margin shelves play an important role in the thermohaline circulation of the Arctic Seas. This project will examine whether the West Spitsbergen Continental Shelf was glaciated during the Last Glacial Maximum (approximately 18 thousand years ago).

Field research will focus on the western part of the Franz Josef Land Archipelago, where ice-free forelands contain abundant raised marine and glacial features. High resolution SPOT satellite imagery will be used as a mapping base to determine the distribution of raised beaches, moraines and other glacial features. Geomorphic and pedologic studies will provide relative ages for a previously isostatic response will be documented by radiocarbon dating of fossils included in raised beaches of known elevation. Particular attention will be given to the recognition of glacial-diamicts and uncomformitites, the collection of micro and macro-fauna for paleenvironmental assessment, and radiocarbon dating and amino acid racemization analyses. These studies will provide new insight into the history and extent of Late Weichselian glaciations on Franz Josef Land and will provide needed data to evaluate conflicting hypotheses regarding Late Weichselian ice volumes in northern Eurasia.\n",

This project is sponsored jointly by NSF and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Professor Zhang is a leading nuclear structure theorist active in worldwide research at the Niels Bohr Institute of the University of Copenhagen and the Joint Institute for Heavy Ion Research at Oak Ridge. His visits with the experimental groups at SUNY Stony Brook and Brookhaven National Laboratory will focus on three research areas that involve theoretical interpretation and guidance of the experimental programs. The three research areas are: (1) nuclear shapes, (2) the source of nuclear collectivity, and (3) dynamic properties. The first area relates to the influence that specific nucleon orbitals have on the shape of the nucleus, the second to the role of the neutron. proton interaction in the onset of collective motion in the nucleus, and the third to transitions from a specific region of stability involving rotational motion to another region. The key to this program is the effective interaction between the experimental and the theoretical approaches to the understanding of these research areas.\n",

Drosophila, or \"fruit flies,\" are essential experimental animals which are used extensively in genetics research. The Mid-America Center maintains 4,061 genetic strains of the most important fruit-fly species, Drosophila melanogaster, which are distributed to institutions around the world for research and teaching purposes. From 1985 to 1989, over 12,000 requests for flies were received and nearly 59,000 stocks were mailed to all 50 states and over 50 foreign countries. These stocks include basic mutants as well as complex mutant combinations and chromosome rearrangements. It is essential that such stocks be maintained because they represent many man-years of genetic research and are difficult, and in some cases impossible, to re- isolate or re-synthesize. In addition, it is much too expensive for each researcher utilizing Drosophila to maintain the full range of stocks it envisions it will need. It is certain that curtailment of the activities of the Mid-America Center would seriously affect genetics research worldwide.\n",

This project is another step forward in this area with the installation of a temperature measurement lidar system for that region of the atmosphere. This will be only the second such system capable of routine temperature measurements in the world and will be the most advanced system. This coupled with the simultaneous measurements with other lidar systems and radar systems at the Urbana,Illinois field station will provide significant new incite into the dynamics of the mesosphere and lower thermosphere.\n",
      "a9001513 DMS $111600 Knight intends to continue to work on problems in recursive model theory, and to analyze methods for organizing and thinking about nested priority arguments. There are now several such methods: the method of \"workers\", developed by Harrington, two versions of \"alpha-systems\", both developed by Ash, and a method of Lemmp and Lerman. The method of workers and the original alpha-systems have each yielded quite a number of results in recursive model theory. Knight has a metatheorem for workers, similar to the one Ash proved for his original alpha-systems, except that not so much is assumed to be r.e., and the conditions are more complicated. Knight hopes both to simplify and to improve the metatheorem for workers. In Knight's metatheorem, as in Ash's original metatheorem, the object produced on the bottom is recursive. Ash's new alpha-systems (simpler than the old), and the method of Lemmp and Lerman, are designed to produce an r.e. object on the bottom. There are many problems in recursive model theory (existence of recursive presentations of groups, etc.), as well as in recursion theory, on which these new methods ought to yield results. Recursion theory as a topic in the foundations of mathematics is motivated by a desire to formalize the property of being computable by an algorithm. The algorithm need not be a practical one, but it must exist and terminate in principal after some finite number of steps.\n",
      "a9001518 DMR $254890 Block copolymers are of great technological importance and simultaneously provide interesting opportunities to study basic statistical effects in physical science. Although some aspects of the science of these copolymers are reasonably well understood, very little is known about their behavior when dissolved in binary liquid solvents or when they occupy the interface between two immiscible liquids, each of which is a good solvent for one block of the copolymer. A series of experiments will be carried out on diblock and alternating copolymers dissolved in liquid mixtures to determine the effect of the polymer on: 1) the thermodynamics and capillary wave spectrum of the liquid-liquid interface, 2) interfacial development under mechanically driven interfacial instabilities, and 3) composition fluctuations in miscible liquid mixtures. In all three cases, the liquid behavior is expected to affect the polymer conformation at the same time as the polymeric degrees of freedom are affecting the interface(s), and the measurements will be directed toward understanding this behavior.\n",
      "a9001519 DMR $135000 The research proposed here is a continuation of the previous grant, aimed at understanding the statistical mechanics and dynamics of a variety of surfaces and interfaces. There are various interesting and fundamental issues, relevant to many different fields that remain to be probed. Most of these questions fall into the following broad categories: (1) Random Manifolds, such as polymers and membranes, obtained from embeddings in a higher dimensional space. (2) Evolving interfaces, such as a growing crystal facet, swelling gel, or a flowing sandpile. (3) Interfaces and Paths in Random Media are relevant to studies as diverse as the trapping of flux lines in a dirty superconductor, to the interference of Feynman paths in a doped semiconductor.\n",
      "a9001520 OPP $50000 This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) supports the research to assess the feasibility of recovering ancient microorganisms entrapped in deep glacial ice cores. A major goal will be to establish the reliability of obtaining ancient organisms for comparative studies with contemporary ogranisms. The reseach will establish valid techniques for the recovery of microorganisms from ice cores stored at the Ice Core Storage Facility in Buffalo, N.Y., and then attempt in recover viable, ancient organisms from ice cores drilled in Greenland and Antarctica. By studying successively older strata in ice cores, the longevity of different taxa entrapped in ice can be estimated. Organisms that are successfully recovered can also be used as model organisms for research on rates of biological evolution, mechanisms of dormancy, their ecological relevance and processes of natural preservation.\n",
      "a9001523 DMS $66319 This research is devoted to the study of choice of the form of the statistical regression function in terms of the exogenous variables in the model when the number of exogenous variables is large. The common practice is to impose conditions such as linearity or additivity to avoid the difficulties associated with sparse data in high dimensions. Estimates of average derivative functionals will be used to select or reject a particular restriction on the form of the regression. The functionals considered are of integral type which may allow their estimation at the usual parametric rate. Estimators of these functionals which are based on kernel density estimators will be considered and their large sample properties analyzed. These estimators will then be used to test various hypotheses concerning the form of the regression function. The finite sample behavior of the proposed estimators and tests will be studied using constructed and real data. Under certain conditions these estimators will be studied for their use in identifying projection directions in projection pursuit regression. Similar functionals closely resembling the Fisher information matrix will be used to determine directions in projection pursuit density estimation.\n",
      "a9001524 BCS $11970 Among the living primates the genus Lemur is one of the most complicated from the taxonomic point of view. There are six recognized species and one, Lemur fulvus, occurs in seven allopatric subspecies. Their relationships to one another and the mode of their genetic differentiation is not known. The PI will examine levels of genetic differentiation associated with various stages in the process of speciation and, using data from the genus Lemur, will examine the model of allopatric speciation. Specifically, the PI will test the hypothesis that there is progressively greater genetic differentiation as comparisons are made among geographic populations, then subspecies, and finally species. These data will also be used to address the systematics of lemurs, and specifically whether Lemur fulvus is ancestral to other species in the genus, as has been proposed.\n",
      "a9001530 MCB $285000 Living matters are sustained by large-scale cycles of energy and chemical elements, and one of the most essential elements in biological materials is nitrogen. To study the many different biological processes which govern the nitrogen status in the biosphere is, therefore, of vital importance. Nitrogenase and nitrite reductase are two enzymes which catalyze key steps in the nitrogen cycle. Nitrogenase catalyzes the conversion of atmospheric dinitrogen into ammonia (nitrogen fixation) and many microorganisms use it to assimilate nitrogen into the living system. Nitrate reductase reduces nitrite to ammonia and a variety of nitrate-reducing bacteria, as well as some sulfate reducing bacteria, use it for terminal respiration and dissimilates nitrogen back to the physical world. Structural and functional studies of these enzymes are therefore of fundamental importance and should provide information pertinent to the understanding of our living environment. In this application, Dr. Huynh proposes to perform Mossbauaer studies of the following enzymes: 1. the vanadium-iron protein of the nitrogenase enzyme system from Azotobacter vinelandii. 2. the nitrite reductase from Desulfovibrio desulfuricans. Both the vanadium-iron protein and nitrite reductase are complex enzymes containing multiple iron centers which can be most effectively studied by Mossbauer spectroscopy. The proposed experiments include (i)characterizations of the native enzymes, (ii)redoxtitration studies, (iii) pH- dependence investigations and (iv)examinations of substrate- and ligand-binding effects. The Mossbauer results will be correlated with data obtained form other physico-biochemical methods, including optical and electron paramagnetic resonance techniques. Dr. Huynh hopes to fully characterize the iron centers in these enzymes, to obtain physical and biochemical properties, to reveal the roles these iron centers play in their enzymatic functions and to enhance our understanding of the mechanisms of biological nitrogen fixation and nitrite reduction.\n",
      "a9001531 EAR $170000 This research is to develop further the theoretical basis for determining 3-D earth structure from long-period seismic data. The next major advance will be to invert a dataset that is an order of magnitude larger, of the order of 50,000 source-receiver pairs which will be developed elsewhere. Attention here will be focused on the accuracy and possible biases of the various approximations and techniques that will have to be employed in such a large-scale study. Specific topics to be addressed are the accurate computation of synthetic long-period seismograms, evaluation of approximate methods and inversion techniques, and theoretical studies of geometrical optics, anisotropy, and the Born approximation.\n",
      "a9001533 DEB $58800 The phylogenetic relationships among the orders of otophysan fishes and the families of catfishes will be investigated using nucleotide sequence variation of ribosomal RNA. Ribosomal RNA sequences will be obtained using a primer-extension sequencing method applied directly to RNA samples isolated from tissue samples. Statistical tests will be applied to these data to resolve alternative hypotheses previously generated from morphological data. The evolutionary events underlying the multiple derivations of complex morphological systems such as the elastic spring apparatus and palatine-maxillary mechanism will be evaluated in the context of a molecular phylogeny. The resulting molecular phylogenies will also be used to test predictions of the vicariance and dispersalist models of vertebrate radiation and to reevaluate major trends of morphological evolution among otophysan fishes. The phylogenetic information contained in different parts of the ribosome will be examined to identify a general range of divergence times over which ribosomal sequence variation is likely to be informative for teleost fishes.\n",
      "a9001535 DEB $58800 Ecotypes of Hemizonia Luzulaefolia (Asteraceae) will be used to examine predictions of two theories concerned with the evolution of plant defenses against herbivores: the resource availability and the apparency hypotheses. The resource availability hypothesis predicts that plants adapted to low- resource environments should allocate proportionally more resources to defense than plants adapted to high-resource environments. Two ecotypes of H.luzulaefolia (one adapted to resource-poor serpentine soil and one adapted to resource-rich sandstone soil) in 1) a reciprocal transplant garden experiment to assess this prediction in terms of plant fitness and 2) a container experiment to examine underlying eco-physiological mechanisms) will be used. H.luzulaefolia produces non-resinous rosette leaves prior to flowering and resinous leaves (presumably a defense against herbivores) when flowering is initiated. In addition, two ecotypes differ in flowering time (spring vs.fall) and in quantity of resins produced. The apparency hypothesis predicts that this variation in the timing and quantity of resin production is attributable to variation in vulnerability to herbivores. This idea will be tested by placing different growth stages of the two ecotypes into the grassland at several times during the season and measure herbivore damage. It is anticipated that results generated from these experiments will provide an empirical base for modifying current theory on the evolution of herbivore defense. //\n",
      "a9001543 DEB $58800 In recent years, genetic evidence has revealed that extra- pair mating is more widespread in apparently monogamous bird species than previously thought. The costs and benefits of extra-pair mating are poorly understood for males and females because of a paucity of data and because, until recently, the genetic techniques available were inadequate for determining paternity in natural populations. In this study, parentage of young in nests of western bluebird (Sialia mexicana) pairs in central coastal California will be determined, and behavioral, demographic and genetic data will be used to address the functional consequences of extra-pair mating. Parentage of young in nests where more than one male cares for young will be determined, as well as whether supernumerary males are nonbreeding helpers or actually father offspring in the nests at which they feed. This study will clarify the mating system of the western bluebired and will help to shed light on the extent and success of extra-pair mating as a reproductive alternative to strict monogamy.\n",

They will investigate the basic mechanisms of solid-phase epitaxy of amorphous silicon on crystalline silicon and the physics of silica/silicon interfaces. Semiconductor processing technologies are becoming increasing dependent on a detailed understanding of non-equilibrium solid- phase interfaces and growth mechanisms. This study will attempt to characterize interfacial properties using Raman spectroscopy, time-resolved ellipsometry, and electrical measurements. Interfacial structure will be modeled using both Molecular-Orbital and Molecular Dynamics calculations. Dr. Motooka's extensive experience with the theoretical analysis of interface structure and proficiency in the interpretation of related experimental data should complement and focus Dr. Fon's broad background in metallurgy, solid-state physics, solid-state devices, and computer simulations.\n",

      "a9001574 DMS $47764 Work on this project focuses on two areas related to the study of solutions of elliptic partial differential equations. These are the analysis of the biharmonic and polyharmonic equations on non-smooth domains and boundary value problems for second order elliptic divergence form operators with non-smooth coefficients. In past work it was discovered that the range of solvability of higher order elliptic operators on non-smooth domains depended on the dimension of the underlying domain. There remains a gap in the range in which the solution will have a finite norm (above the quadratic). If the domain has dimension four or greater then solutions exist with unbounded p-norms for some value of p greater than two. But the first value of p is not known, nor is it known whether this gap reduces to zero as the dimension increases. Work will be done in an effort to obtain sharp estimates on this range. There is a close connection between the study of differential operators on non-smooth domains and those with non-smooth coefficients. Research will concentrate on establishing representations of solutions through integrals of boundary values. This is a particularly delicate matter. In the case of smooth coefficient operators, the integrals are Lebesgue integrals (the harmonic measure is absolutely continuous with respect to surface measure). This is not necessarily the case in general. Work will be done in establishing criteria which will still guarantee the integral representation through approximation procedures. Once these are established, one can then begin to study the behavior of solutions as the variable is made to approach the domain boundary.\n",
      "a9001578 DMS $52550 The principal investigator will study problems concerning manifolds with positive Ricci curvature, harmonic maps between spheres, and geometry and topology of manifolds with boundary. Obstructions to the existence of metrics on Riemannian manifolds with prescribed curvature conditions will be investigated. Dirac bundles and Dirac operators on manifolds with boundary of dimension 4 and 5 will be analyzed. The mathematical object known as a torus has the shape of an inner tube and is positively curved on the outer parts, while negatively curved around the hole. As a fact, its total curvature is zero. A long time ago mathematicians learned that this meant, with a different concept of distance, the torus can appear flat. The principal investigator will continue his research into analogous problems concerning such prescribed curvature on higher-dimensional manifolds.\n",
      "a9001579 OPP $39585 The stability of the West Antarctic ice sheet (WAIS) is an issue of immediate global importance because the ice sheet contains enough water to raise sea level over 5 meters. If the ice sheet experiences a rapid collapse, the accompanying rapid rise in sea level will have dire consequences along coastlines worldwide. The urgency of assessing the stability of the WAIS is fueled by the recent discoveries made by the Siple Coast Project (SCP) of significant changes taking place in West Antarctica. However, the SCP has had a glaciological focus and has not properly assessed the important meteorological and oceanic effects. which play a major role in determining the behavior of the ice sheet and its impact on global climate. What is needed is a multi-disciplinary study of the WAIS where studies in all relevant disciplines are conducted. A plan to integrate these separate investigations is a necessary first step to achieving the goal of understanding the global role of the WAIS and its stability. What is proposed here is to bring together experts from the important polar disciplines for a workshop to formulate a rational plan for the study of the WAIS. The acronym SEARISE (Stability of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet Environment) has been chosen for this program because it provides an identifiable focus of public concern.\n",

Successful data management requires field stations to take advantage of advances in technology, and to support staff at field stations. This project will support a workshop to be held April 22-26, 1990, at the Kellogg Biological Station, as a sucessor to a similar workshop held in 1982. The purpose will be to assess the progress that has been made since the earlier workshop, to share and disseminate information, to recommend standards and protocols to aid collaborative research and to propose new directions for which pilot programs might lead the way. The workshop will be co-sponsored by the Organization of Biological Field Stations (OBFS) and the Southern Association of Marine Labs (SAML), and will represent the diversity of sites and the various stages of development of data management systems in these two groups.

      "a9001583 INT $16799 This award supports cooperative research in physical oceanography to be conducted by Bjorn Kjerfve of the University of South Carolina in collaboration with Bastiaan Knoppers of the Universidade Federal Fluminense in Niteroi, Brazil. The work will consist of the measurement of the dynamic characteristics of the largest coastal lagoon along the Fluminense coastline. It is vital to establish a base line for lagoon dynamics before planned intense development begins. This lagoon is hypersaline, being choked off from the ocean (unlike estuaries where there is a mixing zone). Characteristics to be measured include salinity structure, sedimentation rates (runoff), wind effects, nutrient concentration, temperatures and evaporation rates and tidal dynamics. These data will be compared to those taken in other fresh and brackish water lagoons in which previous oceanographic and ecological studies have been carried out. There are coastal lagoons around the world, notably in New England and the Gulf coast of the U.S. Not all of them are in arid climates but climatic variability affects hydrological and ecological processes and the study of this hypersaline example will extend the range of such effects. It will also add to the extensive biological, chemical, geological and geographical work in progress as well as investigations in health, sociology and economics studies underway on these lagoons. Modelling and the use of this data will help develop predictive capability for linear and nonlinear processes in lagoon systems. Kjerfve's experience in hydrology and ecology will complement those of the Brazilian multidisciplinary team and in particular the biogeochemical work of Knoppers. Students will participate in the work in Brazil and some will follow this field work with Ph.D. studies in the U.S.\n",

Several crystal planes are studied, including some with low and some with high Miller indices. Single-crystal studies are compared with model catalyst studies to ascertain which features of the STM scans are relevant to catalytic performance.

Other experiments involve supplementally feeding animals in natural populations to ascertain the specific role of food abundance in determining these traits. Patterns of response to the different conditions will reveal how important the environment is in determining these traits.\n",
      "a9001588 BCS $10000 ABSTRACT The dissertation examines the acquisition of the tone and accent systems of KiVunjo Chagga, a Bantu language spoken in the Kilimanjaro region of Tanzania. Although it is widely believed that infants acquire prosodic systems very early, there is evidence from English and Asian tone languages that distinctive pitch is not acquired prior to segmental phonology. There has been no comprehensive study of the acquisition of tone in a Bantu-type tone language. This research pays particular attention to the development of distinctive tone, its relationship to the metrical accent system of KiVunjo, and the development of tone rules. Field research consists of a longitudinal naturalistic study of four children, two from age 2 and two from age 3, thereby covering the age range 2-4. The children will be audio recorded in their homes once a month for at least one year. Recording sessions will last an entire day, and will cover a wide range of the child's normal activities and interlocutors. Tapes will be transcribed immediately with the help of a native-speaker assistant, and transcripts will be entered into a computer. The resulting corpus will be available to other researchers.\n",
      "a9001590 CHE $246080 Dr. Erwin D. Poliakoff is supported by a grant from the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to study synchrotron radiation induced fluorescence from molecular ions. These measurements give valuable insight into how electronic and nuclear motions are correlated in excited molecules; moreover, these results will also tell us about the origins of various light sources in the galaxy. This work focuses on the correlation of electronic and nuclear motion (Franck-Condon breakdown), as well as related electron correlation effects (continuum coupling). Dispersed fluorescence has been used in previous work to demonstrate that resolution is not limited by the excitation band width. This capability will permit studies that would not otherwise be feasible, including work on the photoionization of van der Waals species, transfer of shape resonant character between ionization continua and fluorescence from doubly-charged diatomic ions.\n",

      "a9001606 DMS $51000 With this proposal the principal investigator will continue his analytical and numerical studies of discontinuous solutions of mathematical models of viscous, compressible flows in two and three space dimensions. In particular, he will investigate the well-posedness of the boundary value problems for the systems of nonlinear hyperbolic equations resulting from the models, and he will design improved numerical schemes for resolving the discontinuities present in the solutions. Very often mathematicians and fluid dynamicists study one- dimensional models of complicated flow phenomena in order to gain insights into the behavior of real flows in two and three space dimensions. In the present grant the principal investigator will extend some of his results for one-dimensional models of the gasdynamic equations to more realistic models in higher dimensions. Problems in more than one dimension are difficult, and so the investigator will employ a combined analytical- numerical approach to study discontinuous solutions called \"shocks\".\n",
      "a9001610 CMS $20002 This research program is part of the initiative to collect perishable data resulting from the 17 October 1989 Northern California (Loma Prieta) earthquake. The objective is to obtain data on the performance of five soil nailed walls in the San Francisco Bay area during the Loma Prieta earthquake. This perishable data will be compared at a later time with the pre- earthquake measurements on the same walls, in order to evaluate the performance of soil nailed walls under seismic conditions. Soil nailing is a construction procedure used to shore vertical soil cuts for temporary or permanent purposes. Related procedures included conventional soldier pile and tie- back systems. Because of the uncertainties involved with the design of soil nailed walls, building officials have expressed concern regarding soil nailing (Engineering News Record, October 5, 1898). As a result, Professor Felio was appointed Chairman of the American Society of Civil Engineers-Los Angeles Section Task Committee on Soil Nailing in order to establish design, construction, and monitoring guidelines for the City of Los Angeles. This committee has been collecting information on the subject as well as contacting researchers, constructors, and designers in the United States for information. The survey is being supervised by Professor Felio and Mr. Pirooz Barar of Pirooz Barar and Associates, San Francisco, a soil nailing designer in California with experience in supervising the construction of soil nailed walls in San Francisco, Oakland, and the Los Angeles area.\n",

      "a9001615 BCS $14919 This work seeks to examine people's psychological and physiological reactions to the extreme stress produced by a recent natural disaster, the Bay Area earthquake of 17 October 1989. The PI has developed a theory of inhibition and confrontation with stressors, which holds that when people attempt to suppress reactions to stressful events, when they refuse to talk about the event, consciously try to stop thinking about it, etc., they put themselves at risk for later, stress related reactions, which can include the intrusion of debilitating thoughts, autonomic nervous system activity and, over time, an increase in health problems. In the first study, a sample of Bay Area residents will be surveyed repeatedly over the course of a year (via telephone), and sequential measures of their reaction to the earthquake will be taken. It is predicted that people will differ in the ways they inhibit, or confront, the disaster, and these reactions, in turn, will have implications for later physical health status. In addition the researchers will interview a subsample of the telephone survey respondents, and take a series of noninvasive physiological measures (e.g., blood pressure), to determine potential relationships between reactions to the earthquake (as evidenced on the survey questionnaire) and physiological status. Also, approximately 700 Bay Area residents (and a comparison group of 350 Dallas, TX, residents) will be surveyed over the course of the coming year to determine possible changes in people's reactions to, and perceptions of, the disaster; comparison of these responses with those of the repeatedly measured group will be made to determine the effects of multiple testing. In addition, health status measures also will be taken. Finally, various college and non-college groups who differ in terms of their plans to stay or quit the Bay Area also will be interviewed, and various health status measures will be applied. The research will attempt to show that the form of people's reaction to a disaster, and possibly the reactions they exhibit over a period of time following the disaster, will have implications for their psychological and physical health. The PI's use of the Bay Area disaster as a natural manipulation is a smart and opportunistic attempt to make a positive gain from a terrible catastrophe. A rapid NSF response to this request would have been very difficult without the SGER program. For this reason alone, the SGER initiative is to be applauded.\n",

      "a9001619 CCR $154531 Discrete pattern matching includes a large class of problems of pattern matching over discrete domains. These problems are driven by several applications, mostly in the areas of molecular biology and information retrieval. There are several features that are common to most of these problems. The input is usually a sequence, a set of sequences, a set of integer-weighted sequences, or even a graph of sequences, over a finite alphabet. The goal of the problem is to identify common patterns (i.e., a subsequence or a set of subsequences) that satisfy several constraints and/or optimize several objectives. The problems differ not only by the constraints and objectives, but also by the type of input. This project mainly concerns algorithmic questions in discrete pattern matching. The investigators will identify important problems, develop new algorithms for a variety of problems, find common algorithmic techniques, and study relationships among different problems. The emphasis will be on four kinds of problems which are identified by their domains: sequence comparisons, which involve problems of finding large common subsequences of two (or more) sequences; pattern-sequence comparisons, which involve finding more complicated patterns, such as regular expressions of sequences, in given sequences; pattern matching in hypertext systems, which generalizes the previous problems to \"hyper- sequences\" or, in other words, pieces of sequences connected by links; and hierarchical pattern matching, which involves finding patterns over domains that are by themselves patterns obtained from other matches.\n",

Students will be matched with a research project and faculty mentor prior to their arrival. The ten-week program begins with an intensive, one-week training period in which students are given a thorough overview of the facilities and research tools available at CASA, and develop a detailed research proposal to serve as a plan of action for the remaining nine weeks. Throughout the ten-week program students meet daily in a 3 credit course entitled \"APAS 4010, Astrophysical Research Seminar\". The course was designed expressly for the purpose of the CASA REU program; it presents students with a theoretical framework in relevant astrophysical topics, provides a wide survey of the astrophysical research at CASA, and offers advice and guidance on graduate school or future careers in astrophysics. Students are expected to present both oral and written Final Reports on their research at the end of the ten-week program. The program anticipates a progressive pattern of student activities. Students begin by participating in our summer program, in which they will develop the background and skills needed for continued research success. Following the summer program, it is hoped that students will continue with independent support to the development of a senior thesis in astrophysics, which in turn can lead into a successful graduate experience and career.\n",
      "a9001631 DMS $59500 Using the method of induced hyperbolicity developed earlier by the principal investigator, families of nonlinear dynamical systems will be studied. Of particular interest will be their stochastic behavior. One-parameter families of diffeomorphisms close to the unstable manifold of the Feigenbaum fixed point will be inspected. And Sullivan's approach will be used to investigate when topological conjugacy implies quasiconformal conjugacy for maps with absolutely continuous invariant measures. An invariant measure of a dynamical system is positive on invariant sets of the system which attract or repel. The principal investigator will study such systems which are close in some parameter space to the Feigenbaum limit. This limit of period-doubling bifurcations has raised intense interest from investigators in a wide variety of physical and biological sciences. Just past this limit lies the onset of chaos.\n",
      "a9001633 DMS $26543 This project is concerned with two problems in quadratic form theory. The first concerns the existence of composition laws for sums of squares. The second problem considers the connections between the behavior of quadratic forms over a field of characteristic different than two and the types of Galois groups which can arise over that field. This project is related to the classical study of quadratic forms. One of the early achievements in this field is the discovery by Gauss that every positive whole number is the sum of four squares. This area is important not only in pure number theory but in geometry and the mathematics of relativity.\n",
      "a9001635 DMS $50300 This research will apply asymptotic approximation techniques in the study of the dynamics of molecular systems in the so- called Born-Oppenheimer limit. In particular, the principal investigator will consider scattering problems, the effects of electron energy level crossing, avoided crossings and the effects of oscillating electromagnetic fields. This will be accomplished using analytical and numerical methods. Most molecules consist of complicated systems of electrons whose behavior determines the macroscopic (or bulk) properties of materials. It is especially important to have mathematical models of these electron systems, since understanding the behavior of the electrons enables us to understand the conductivity of a material, for example. In this proposal the principal investigator will use analytical and numerical methods to study how electrons behave in crossing from one energy level to another.\n",
      "a9001637 CHE $5000 This award from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program will enable twenty U.S. graduate students to attend the XIV International Conference on Organometallic Chemistry in Detroit, Michigan, August 19-24, 1990. The conference is expected to attract more than 500 scientists with demonstrated research interests in organometallic chemistry and particularly its applications in new materials. The primary goals of the 1990 meeeting are to provide opportunities for full participation both to young researchers in the United States and to scientists from less-developed nations, to stimulate interaction between academic and industrial chemists in the U.S., and to provide a forum for the latest developments in the broad field of organometallic chemistry.\n",
      "a9001642 MCB $3000 This project submitted by the American Society of Human Genetics, provides partial support for the scientific program of the 8th International Congress of Human Genetics to be held in Washington, DC, October 6-11, 1991. These Congresses, convened every five years since 1956, provide an excellent forum for the presentation of fundamental research results in human genetics to the international community of scholars in this rapidly advancing field. The primary purpose of the Congress is to enhance the body of knowledge in human genetics through the exchange of information that will take place. This Congress comes at a most propitious time when important advances in basic molecular genetics are being incorporated into the practice of human genetics. The obvious potential generated by such powerful analytical techniques as those employing recombinant DNA, DNA- and chromosome-mediated gene transfer, flow cytometry, polymerase chain reaction, and homologous recombination indicate this to be a particularly opportune time for such as international meeting. It should be noted that the extensive international collaboration in human genetics which presently exists will continue to develop as dictated by complementary expertise in different areas for the most economical and efficient use of limited scientific resources.\n",
      "a9001644 DBI $52000 Northwestern University will purchase an inductively coupled plasma spectrometer in order to carry out analyses of chemical elements in the fields of anthropology, biophysics, and bioinorganic chemistry. The instrument is needed by the faculties of the Department of Chemistry and the Department of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, and Cell Biology for research in the following areas: 1. Diet and the inorganic analysis of excavated human bone 2. Heavy metals in biological systems 3. Long-range electron transfer and hemoglobin function 4. Polynucleotide coordination chemistry of metallocene antitumor agents At present, the institution does not have an inductively coupled plasma spectrometer, so its acquisition will be a significant addition, enhancing both current and future research efforts.\n",
      "a9001645 PHY $197000 Theoretical and numerical studies will be initiated for an array of problems in gravitational physics and relativistic astrophysics. Topics of interest include (1) development of techniques in numerical relativity and their application in modeling sources of gravitational radiation and in exploring nonlinear, dynamical spacetimes; (2) numerical modeling of the tidal disruption of stars during close encounters with massive black holes and the possible relevance of disruption for feeding active galactic nuclei; (3) the calculation of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) winds from accretion disks and stars and the development of a general relativistic MHD numerical scheme; and (4) a study of the recently discovered eclipsing millisecond pulsar 1957+20. The goal of this work is to acquire a deeper understanding of self-gravitating and dynamical systems and of high energy (relativistic) phenomena. Many of these physical studies rely upon the use of large-scale numerical modeling techniques. Accordingly, useful byproducts of such studies are almost invariably new and refined numerical algorithms. The project relating to the eclipsing pulsar 1957+20 is of a more phenomenological nature and relies upon the close interplay between theoretical calculation and observational evidence.\n",
      "a9001647 DMR $212400 This research project is developing a new technique, based on the detection of interface elastic waves by Brillouin scattering, to measure the bulk elastic constants of solids under hundreds of kilobars of hydrostatic pressure. This unique capability will permit the investigation of the almost universal softening of acoustic phonons with pressure in cubic semiconductors and their potential role in structural phase transitions. Measurements on semiconductor alloys and heterostructures will allow isolation of compositional and interfacial strain effects. Resonant Raman scattering will be employed to study the exchange-mediated phonon renormalization discovered in cobalt-based dilute magnetic semiconductors. Antoher program on II-V semiconductors is attempting to elucidate the fundamental driving mechanism for their novel ordering during epitaxial growth and to explore the possibility to stabilize through strain otherwise unstable crystal lattices.\n",
      "a9001648 OCE $37021 Between 10% and 40% of the Vanadium and Uranium entering the modern ocean as dissolved river input is eventually buried in sediments overlain by anoxic bottom water. Previous work by Dr. Mix and his colleague Dr. Emeron from the University of Washington has found that concentrations of V and U in foram tests have varied over the last 150 Kyrs. Provided the assumption is true tht formas incorporated these metals in equilibrium with seawater, this preliminary data suggests that bottom, water during the last glacial period was more oxygenated that at present, and that between Atlantic and Pacific bottom water was substantially different from that of today. In this renewal award the PIs will to continue their research in several directins: 1) they will perform culturing experiments with collaborator Dr. Erez in Israel to determine the uptake patterns of V and U in live forams; 2) they will improve solid source mass spectometry techniques for measuring V and U in single species of forams; and 3) they will apply these techniques to refine the history of anoxia in the world's oceans since the last interglacial\n",
      "a9001651 EIA $1641404 This is a proposal to build cost-effective specialized computers for scientific computation. A set of hardware and software will be developed to allow rapid construction of very specialized computers: computers that are capable of running exactly one program. The computers are built from many data path parts, interconnected to reflect the control flow of the program to be executed. Several of these computers are under construction for different problems, including the n-body problem of predicting planetary motions, some electronic simulation problems, and large-scale particle simulations. Comparison with other computational approaches to this problem will allow an accurate evaluation of this technique.\n",
      "a9001652 BCS $7967 The ability of anthropologists to determine aspects of an animal's diet from morphological characteristics of its dentition has greatly increased in recent years, especially through the use of new techniques such as SEM (scanning electron microscope) examination of minute wear characteristics of the teeth. The Principal Investigators will utilize this technique to determine food categories of a diverse group mammals, including primates, and use this information to make inferences about the diet of an important group of Early Cenozoic primates, the Omomyidae. This study will be the first to assess quantitatively hypotheses about dietary reconstruction of early fossil primates. The potential application of this study for understanding dietary aspects of other fossil taxa is great.\n",
      "a9001654 BES $46525 This is an award to provide support for research on the development of an instrument that can be used to measure the velocity of water flowing in subsurface aquifers. The basis of instrument operation is the generation and observation of a migrating thermal plume in the vicinity of the heated probe. The proposed instrument will be equipped to sense the motion of groundwater by monitoring the discharge of heat from the isothermally heated cylinder to the surrounding soil as a function of location on the probe surface. Unlike presently available devices, groundwater flow is directed around rather than through the probe. This provides the instrument with the advantage of component isolation from the groundwater environment. Hence, the probe is expected to maintain excellent long term stability (years). An accurate knowledge of groundwater movement is needed as greater pressures are exerted on our available groundwater resources. The depletion and recharge of groundwater supplies as well as the migration of contaminant \"plumes\" through groundwater can only be predicted given a knowledge of groundwater flow characteristics. This primarily entails a complete knowledge of groundwater flow speed and direction for the zone of interest. This award was made in accord with criteria outlined in NSF 89-85, Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER).\n",

The design is based on the model of transmission of information from the human eye to the visual cortex. The technique for implementing the model is pulse coded neural type circuits. A theory is being developed to explain the relationship between the frequency generated by neural type circuits and the input voltage level. Neural type cells are being designed, fabricated, and measured to test the theory and verify designs.\n",
      "a9001662 DMR $364500 Several critical issues are examined related to fatigue crack initiation and microcrack growth. Included are the effects of subsurface environmental species on fatigue; the role of surface reactivity on fatigue life; theoretical analysis of the slip band spacing; and effects of material type. The significance of subsurface incorporation of environmental species on fatigue is determined by measuring fatigue crack initiation in selected gaseous environments (oxygen and other selected gases). The correlation between slip band spacing and fatigue life is examined to extend current theory on periodic slip band arrays and their influence on crack initiation.\n",
      "a9001663 DMS $88000 The principal investigator will continue his important work on the partial differential equations that arise in various areas of continuum mechanics. In particular, he will apply advanced mathematical tools to study the general theory of multiphase thermomechanics as it relates to interfacial dynamics and phenomena involving melting and freezing. He will also investigate some unusual partial differential equations that are found in flows through porous media and in biological dispersal. The work of the principal investigator concerns the development and study of mathematical models that attempt to describe such complicated physical phenomena as the growth of crystals with facets and corners, the evolution of a melting-freezing wave, and more generally the creation of ordered structures in media through the action of curved fronts that move through the media. As an example, think of trying to describe quantitatively what happens if you draw a hot wire through a block of ice. It is a complicated process involving melting and re-freezing, which is difficult to study because the boundary between the melted and unmelted ice is so sensitive to the temperature of the wire and other factors.\n",
      "a9001664 BCS $11733 Under the guidance of Dr. Susan McIntosh, Mr. Tereba Togola will conduct archaeological survey and excavation in the Mema or \"Dead Delta\" region of Mali. The results of this work will form the basis for his doctoral dissertation. The Mema, as geomorphological data indicates, was once a well watered region which coincided with the inland delta of the Niger River. A change in the river's course has turned the region to desert. The small amount of archaeological research which has been done in the region indicates that it contains archaeological sites which probably span several millennia. Areal photographs, however, indicate that the region is dotted with possibly hundreds of \"tells\" or habitation mounds. Past uncontrolled excavations recovered such artifacts as statuettes of horseman, iron spear and arrowheads, and multi-legged vases. However, faunal and floral remains were not collected and the subsistence base for this culture remains unknown. Likewise neither an absolute nor a relative chronology exists. Through a combination of survey, correlation of sites with ancient landforms, and excavation at several sites, Mr. Togola will collect both chronological and subsistence information. This project is important for several reasons. First, it will fill in what is almost a complete archaeological blank. It will provide information on how cultures at a very simple level of technology adapted to a rigorous Saharan environment and, hopefully, shed light on the development of agriculture pastoralism and early iron working in sub-Saharan Africa. It should also provide information on the rise of African kingdoms. Finally, it will aid in the training of an extremely promising young scientist.\n",

The International Association of Applied Psychology is the largest international organization of individual psychologists with over 3000 members (one-third from the U.S.) in nine substantive divisions. This meeting is being co-sponsored by the Japanese Psychological Association and the Science Council of Japan and will include over 100 symposia on a wide variety of scientific topics.\n",
      "a9001668 BCS $11995 Under the guidance of Dr. Susan McIntosh, Ms. Helen Haskell will conduct archaeological survey and excavation in the Mema or \"Dead Delta\" region of Mali. The results of this work will form the basis for her doctoral dissertation. The Mema, as geomorphological data indicates, was once a well watered region which coincided with the inland delta of the Niger River. A change in the river's course has turned the region to desert. The small amount of archaeological research which has been done in the region indicates that it contains archaeological sites which probably span several millennia. They include at least two which document the transition from a pure hunting and gathering existence to one which incorporated livestock and domesticated plants. The goal of Ms. Haskell's research is to shed light on this transition period. Guiding herself with aerial photographs, Ms. Haskell will conduct a vehicle survey of the region, noting both ancient landforms and scatters of archaeological materials. In conjunction, these data will provide information on prehistoric landscape use. She will also conduct test excavations at two sites and collect pottery, stone tools, and other cultural remains as well as floral and faunal materials. This project is important for several reasons. First, it will fill in what is almost a complete archaeological blank. It will provide information on how cultures at a very simple level of technology adapted to a rigorous Saharan environment and, hopefully, shed light on the introduction of agriculture and pastoralism to sub-Saharan Africa. Finally, it will aid in the training of an extremely promising young scientist.\n",
      "a9001669 DMS $20000 This award supports the research in algebraic geometry and number theory of Professor David Harbater of the University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Harbater has proposed to continue his study of Galois covers of arithmetic varieties and of arithmetic intersection theory. He will work to construct Galois covers over the rational line having special type of Galois group and ramification, and in his intersection-theoretic work, he plans to use a horizontal pairing that he has recently defined in order to study arithmetic surfaces and to enlarge the Arakelov divisor group and study the fine structure at infinity. This is research in the field of arithmetic algebraic geometry, a subject that combines the techniques of algebraic geometry and number theory. In its original formulation, algebraic geometry treated figures that could be defined in the plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Number theory started with the whole numbers and such questions as divisibility of one whole number by another. These two subjects, seemingly so far apart, have in fact influenced each other from the earliest times, but in the past quarter century the mutual influence has increased greatly. The field of arithmetic algebraic geometry now uses techniques from all of modern mathematics, and is having corresponding influence beyond its own borders.\n",
      "a9001677 DMS $29800 This award supports the research in combinatorics and number theory of Professor Wen-Ching Li of The Pennsylvania State University. Dr. Li's project is centered on questions relating modular forms to graph theory. Among the questions she will investigate are: to realize certain Ramanujan graphs as quotients of trees associated to projective linear groups over p-adic fields; to continue her collaboration with Dr. F.K. Hwang of Bell Laboratories on generalized double loop networks; and to study the Galois structure of p-Sylow subgroups of ideal class groups. Non-Euclidean plane geometry began in the early nineteenth century as a mathematical curiosity, but by the end of that century, mathematicians had realized that many objects of fundamental importance are non-Euclidean in their basic nature. The detailed study of non-Euclidean plane geometries has given rise to several branches of modern mathematics, of which the study of modular and automorphic forms is one of the most active. This field is principally concerned with questions about the whole numbers, but in its use of geometry and analysis, it retains connection to its historical roots. The work of Professor Li is in this tradition, but extends beyond the traditional boundaries of the theory of modular forms in a particularly interdisciplinary thrust.\n",
      "a9001678 DMR $330000 Structure and dynamics of polymer-based glasses are studied below the glass-transition temperature with a combination of spectroscopy, theory, and polymer science. This approach operates at the interface of physical chemistry and material science to utilize molecular information to account for observed bulk properties. Nuclear magnetic resonance, the tool utilized in this investigation, probes structure and motion at the level of chemical groups which is then related to the macroscopic or bulk material properties of the multicomponent glasses. Local intermolecular structure in these amorphous materials is determined by carbon-13 spin diffusion experiments, while molecular reorientation is monitored with spin relaxation and line shape experiments. Rapid development of NMR experiments and instrumentation continues to offer new avenues for the study of solids which will provide a level of insight not attainable a few years ago. Quantitative interpretational models are developed which link the spectroscopic data to mechanical and thermal response as well as such technologically relevant materials behaviour as plasticization and permeability. The particular multicomponent glasses, polycarbonates and their mixtures, are selected for study as the result of their interesting and important materials properties. The interpretational efforts are also tied to the development of theory. The use of lattice models to interpret polymer-diluent structure and dynamics as well as mobilityof sorbed gas is a case in point. Simulation and modeling are used to assist in the development of physically sensible interpretational models.\n",
      "a9001685 CMS $49936 This project involves a study of recovery, reconstruction and mitigation activities in Charleston, South Carolina in the aftermath of Hurricane Hugo. The research will have three primary goals. First, to examine reconstruction policies in relationship to their impact upon mitigation. Second, to analyze the influence of hazard reduction activities in one area (seismic hazards) upon the impact and recovery from a related, though different, hazard. Third, to study the effect of place specific sense of community upon the reconstruction and mitigation processes. Data sources will include interviews with officials, a survey of households, and relevant documents and reports.\n",
      "a9001689 DMS $123150 This project is an investigation into the representation theory and cohomology of finite groups over fields of prime characteristic. Of particular interest is the structure of modules and the homological properties of modules. The p+incipal investigator will work on the complexes associated to polynomial subrings of the cohomology ring of a group. He will also study topological applications of the theory of varieties and cohomology rings. The research supported concerns the representation of finite groups over fields. The structure of the groups is realized through the action of the groups as transformations on spaces. This is currently one of the most active areas of pure algebra.\n",
      "a9001690 CTS $75000 The research objective is to improve the fabrication of optical fibers (waveguides), by using aerosol doping. The proposed method involves the transport and evaporation of an aerosol of solution droplets in the MCVD (Modified Chemical Vapor Deposition) and OVD (Outside Vapor Deposition) techniques. The focus of this research is on the modelling fluid mechanics and heat transfer aspects. The results will be included in previously developed computer codes for the MCVD process. This work will be done in collaboration with the experimental effort carried out at Brown University. The novelty of the proposal consists in the way in which the mist is created by an ultrasonic nebulizer and transported to the deposition surface. The new techniques for the doping of non- volatile dopants into optical fibers have particular relevance to the fabrication of fiber laser amplifiers for telecommunications purposes.\n",
      "a9001691 DMR $334800 This project examines transient liquid phase bonding with the aim of modeling this joining process and determining the effects of processing variables. The approach is aimed at predicting those alloy systems that respond to transient liquid phase bonding and quantifying important features of the process, such as the solidification kinetics, effects of solid solubility and phase equilibria, influence of surface tensions, generic design of interlayers, etc. Out of this research a clear rationale for design of interlayers based on thermodynamic and transport properties of the materials' systems should evolve. Potential future applications include transient liquid phase bonding of electronic packaging, advanced metal matrix composites, ceramic- to-metal bonding, and reactive metal joining.\n",
      "a9001693 DMS $61850 This research is concerned with characterizing geometries related to the Lie incidence geometries and other geometries related to simple groups. One part concerns geometries whose basic planar unit is an affine plane. A critical side issue of that study has been the determination of the geometric hyperplanes of the Lie incidence geometries. In this connection a geometric characterization of alternating k-linear forms seems imminent. This would show that all hyperplanes of Grassman spaces arise from such forms. A second part concerns a more long-range effort to generalize the characterizations of Lie incidence systems into a systematic whole. The third concerns some new directions into \"non-parabolic\" geometries related to simple groups. The fourth concerns substructures of polar spaces. The research in this project involves the interplay between finite dimensional geometry and the actions of groups of transformations on these geometries. This work has implications for the structure of finite groups, for algebraic coding theory, and for finite geometry.\n",
      "a9001695 INT $17500 This U.S.-Brazil Cooperative Research award supports cooperative research in developmental neurobiology to be conducted by Dr. Torsten Wiesel and Dr. David Sretavan of Rockefeller University and Dr. Ary Ramoa of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The goal of this research is to understand how precise patterns of axonal projections, present in the mature mammalian visual system, are established during development. The experiments will focus on three areas. First, is the nature of the cellular interactions between developing retinal axons and neuro- epithelial cells at the optic chiasm. Second, is the identity and spatial-temporal distribution of cell surface molecules present on both retinal axons and neuroepithelial cells. Third, is the further development and refinement of an in vitro culture system to study retinal ganglion cell axon pathfinding. Results from this set of studies will not only lead to a better understanding of how a major axon pathway in the visual system is formed during embryonic development, but will also provide insight into how specific axonal projections may arise in other parts of the central nervous system. Dr. Ramoa will bring to this project his expertise on the embryonic development of mammalian retinal ganglion cells and will also benefit by learning a powerful research technique which will be of direct use in his own research in Brazil. Dr. Ramoa's past research has focused on the development of mammalian retinal ganglion cells in terms of the maturation of their morphological features and their electrophysio- logical properties. While in the U.S., Dr. Ramoa will work with Dr. David Sretavan using hybridoma techniques to generate monoclonal antibodies directed against molecules present on developing retinal ganglion cells and the neuroepithelial cells of the optic chiasm.\n",
      "a9001696 DMS $94700 This project is concerned with the algebraic theory of quadratic forms over fields of characteristic different from two. The principal investigator will investigate torsion-free properties in the Witt ring using Galois cohomology with coefficients in various Galois modules. He will also study quadratic forms over elliptic curves defined over an arbitrary field. In particular, he will use etale cohomology to investigate the Witt ring of such forms, especially when defined over a local field. This project is concerned with the theory of quadratic forms. A quadratic form is a polynomial function of several variables which is homogeneous of degree two. Quadratic forms over fields of characteristic other than two arise naturally from the symmetric inner products on vector spaces over these fields. Thus the forms are intimately connected to the geometry of the space.\n",
      "a9001697 CHE $59000 This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work of Dr. Joseph J. Grabowski at Harvard University. The results of this investigation will provide new insights into the fundamental details of the processes by which chemical reactions take place. Dr. Grabowski will employ the Flowing Afterglow and Selected Ion Flow Tube techniques to examine, probe, and define mechanisms of gas-phase, organic, ion-molecule reactions. Competitive reactions will be employed so that accurate product ratios will provide direct information about the alternative reaction channels in the absence of solvent effects. Both positive-ion and negative-ion systems will be studied, and the investigation will focus on comparisons of such reaction pairs as elimination-substitution, competitive H-atom transfers, and reactions at differently hybridized carbon centers in the same molecule.\n",
      "a9001698 DMR $325800 This research consists of an experimental and theoretical investigation of grain growth in polycrystalline films on single crystal substrates. Reflected high energy and transmission electron diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and thin film X-ray texture analysis are employed to characterize the film grain size and orientation. Metal-on-metal, metal-on-mica, and metal-on-alkali halide model systems are the principal materials under study. Experimental results on grain growth are compared to predictions from computer simulations and analytical theories. A primary goal is to determine the film/substrate interface energy as a function of relative film/substrate orientation by experimental methods and compare these results with atomistic computer simulations.\n",

Established in 1974 with funds from the National Science Foundation and with construction provided by Harvard University, the cineradiographic facility is a unique research resource that is extensively used in experimental investigations of biomechanics, locomotion, feeding and respiration in representatives of every vertebrate class. The apparatus, which simultaneously provides cinefluorographic imagery and permanent (16 mm) film records at speed of 50 - 200 frames/second, is in urgent need of engineering overhaul and replacement of parts. Current and anticipated future use of this facility, which is essential to the future development of organismal biology, depends upon upgrading the equipment.\n",
      "a9001701 BCS $11382 Research in Plio-Pleistocene hominid paleontology over the past four decades has focused largely on exploration and recovery of fossils and artifacts from sites in East Africa. All five known australopithecine sites in southern Africa were discovered between 1924 and 1948; no new locality has been found in over forty years. In order to appreciate the course of early hominid development beyond that represented in East Africa, and in order to gain a more precise picture of chronological relationships, it is critical that additional fossiliferous localities be discovered in southern Africa. Plio-Pleistocene sediments in southern Africa are represented by breccia-filled caves within the limestones of the Transvaal System. The purpose of this project is to undertake a systematic, exploratory survey of the outcrops along the eastern escarpment of the Transvaal System for fossiliferous breccia caves, and to identify sites for future, long-term excavation. The chances of finding such a rewarding site may not be high, but the extreme value to anthropology if such a site is found makes this exploration a most worthwhile risk.\n",
      "a9001702 DMS $65000 The principal investigator will study pseudodifferential techniques in the study of degenerate elliptic equations with applications to geometry. He will extend techniques to determine a spectral analysis of the Hodge-Laplace operator acting on differential forms on complete asymptotic hyperbolic manifolds of infinite volume and on geometrically finite quotients of hyperbolic space. Related projects involve the study of the relationship between unique continuation theorems for the Laplacian at infinity and the presence of negative curvature. For many years mathematicians have studied the behavior of certain differential operators on hypersurfaces which extend off to infinity. This study has its origins in the calculus of Newton. In this project the principal investigator will analyze operators which have large variations over very large domains \"near\" infinity. In the past, only progress on operators which have small local variations was made.\n",
      "a9001704 DMR $367800 This program explores the defect structure of quasicrystals, superconducting oxides, and amorphous alloys using the technique of atomic pair distribution function analysis (PDF). The PDF method has been employed primarily for amorphous solids and liquids and is now being used in the examination of non-periodic atomic displacements in more ordered solids. The PDF method is refined further in this research, which examines the statistical noise, lattice dynamics, and techniques for improved accuracy in the differential anomalous x-ray scattering experiments. The main focus of the grant is on developing understanding of defect structure in the above materials, which have high incidence of atoms which deviate in position from their average sites.\n",
      "a9001705 DMI $120000 This is a program of research on several topics in combinatorial optimization with the objective of enhancing understanding of the underlying mathematics of some combinatorial problems. The importance of the research lies in the fact that a better understanding of the mathematics associated with these problems (most of them belonging to the class of nonpolynomial- complete or hard problems) can be used in the design of algorithms that solve and prove optimality of medium to large instances that typically arise in real world applications. The research includes investigation of the properties of 0, 1 matrices, whose associated set packing polytope has integer extreme points, and the facial structure of some combinatorial polytopes associated with connectivity and partitioning problems on graphs. The algorithmic issues associated with the detection of violated constraints for such problems will be investigated. The problem area of combinatorial optimization is very important, a breakthrough in this area would be highly leveraged.\n",
      "a9001707 DMS $205450 One investigator will study problems in the areas of rigidity theorems for Riemannian manifolds, the structure of manifolds without conjugate points, and sharp isoperimetric inequalities. A second investigator will study related problems in the areas of degenerate systems of partial differential equations, isospectral deformations of Riemannian structures, and minimal isometric embeddings of spherical space forms in spheres. The problems to be investigated in this project arise from an example due to Milnor of two isospectral manifolds which are not isometric. While the original example was sixteen dimensional, more recently three dimensional examples have been constructed. Analogously, one might ask if two round drums which have the same rough shape and which sound the same when struck, have the same exact shape. In fact, they must. These two investigators will study related deep questions for higher dimensional hypersurfaces.\n",
      "a9001710 DMS $576415 The topics of investigation range over a wide spectrum in probability and statistics. They include probability problems arising from Computer Science, random trees, asymptotic theory of prediction regions and of confidence regions, distances between empirical processes and their Gaussian counterparts, minimum distance methods, stochastic estimation procedures, inference for time series with infinite variance, non-parametric function estimation, set statistics, and contour estimation. Many of the studies will be computer intensive.\n",
      "a9001712 DMS $25000 The aim of this project is the analysis of classes of holomorphic functions of several complex variables. The regularity of holomorphic functions defined in a domain becomes less definite as the independent variable approaches the boundary of the domain. This boundary behavior is the main thrust of this activity. Boundary properties of functions defined in a disc in one complex dimension are well understood. A natural analogue in several dimensions is the ball. Even in this case, information is far from complete. In the study of holomorphic Sobolev and Besov spaces, it can be shown that functions have unique limits on approach to the boundary provided certain exceptional sets are avoided. Some progress has been made in characterizing exceptional sets in terms of their capacity. Further effort will be devoted to refining these results. A related line of study will consider the complex tangential derivative of functions in Lipschitz classes. It appeared that when the Lipschitz constant is equal to one-half, the tangential derivatives in the class are p-th power integrable for all values of the parameter. This turned out to be false, leading to a reconsideration of how functions in this class behave near the boundary. Work will be done on the question. A second line of investigation concerns the restriction of holomorphic Sobolev spaces to complex tangential manifolds. There is ample evidence to suggest that the restricted classes are exactly the real Besov spaces. Work will continue on the problem of determining when a function in such a Besov space can be extended to a holomorphic function of the same type.\n",
      "a9001714 CHE $348699 This research program is being supported by the Organic Synthesis Program. Aspects of the chemistry of compounds containing sulphur, selenium and tellurium will be pursued which have the potential to impact on a diverse number of areas such as organic metals and optical sensors. The investigation in organochalcogen chemistry will emphasize the following areas: l. Organosulfur Chemistry The chemistry of little explored types of thiocarbonyl compounds will be studied (e.g., thioquinones, thionoanhydrides). Other sulfur heterocycles which are potential pi donors (e.g., tetrathiafulvalene derivatives, polythiophenes, etc.) or LB film candidates will also be objects of investigation. 2. Organoselenium Chemistry Attention will be focussed on new organoselenium reagents, new selenium-containing pi donors, and selenocarbonyl derivatives. 3. Organotellurium Chemistry New tellurium-containing TTF and vinylogous TTF derivatives will be synthesized. Attempts will be made to synthesize tellurium analogs of the well known 1,2,3-thiadiazoles. The chemistry of new tellurium-containing functional groups will be investigated.\n",

Platau has been awarded a grant from The Special Projects Office of The Chemistry Division with additional support from The Division of Materials Research, The Division of Information, Robotics and Intelligent Systems, and The Division of Instrumentation and Resources to help defray expenses associated with hosting the 12th International CODATA Conference. The conference will be held in Columbus Ohio on July 15-19, 1990. The theme of the conference is \"Data for Discovery\", and it will provide a framework for discussion by international experts on the following major areas: 1) Prediction of Global Change; 2) Spatial Databases; 3) Materials Properties Data Systems; 4) Expert Systems and Other Knowledge Tools; 5) Trends in Integration of Information Across Biology; and 6) Impact of New Technology on Data Handling. The NSF contribution to the overall funding of this meeting will help to provide travel and subsistence expenses for several of the invited speakers.\n",
      "a9001721 DMS $75879 This research involves convexity-related inequalities and positive dependence in statistics. The related areas in statistics include multivariate analysis, reliability theory, multiple decision problems, and statistical computing. The mathematical tools to be used are convexity, majorization theory, conditioning and mixture of distributions. The research will provide a partial ordering of positive dependence among random variables via multivariate majorization. The effects of positive dependence in system reliability theory will be explored. Open problems in optimal-partitioning inequalities will be studied and a comparison of statistical experiments via positive dependence will be made.\n",
      "a9001722 DMS $60200 Let L be a local or global number field which is a finite extension of the field K. When L/K is Galois, classical Galois module theory seeks to understand the ring of integers in a number field as a module over its Galois group ring. This research will examine several questions in this vein. The principal investigator will determine suitable criteria for the ring of integers in a number field to be locally free over its Galois group ring. He will also work on the classification of commutative, cocommutative prime-power rank Hopf algebras. Number theory, which is the study of the properties of the whole numbers, is one of the oldest branches of mathematics. In modern days, problems in number theory have furnished the driving force for the creation of new mathematics in the fields of pure algebra, analysis, and geometry. Some of the most recent applications of number theory have appeared in theoretical computer science and coding theory.\n",
      "a9001726 DMS $110000 This research provides surrogate statistical models for the usually deterministic output of complex computer models which cannot be directly explored in great detail because of their size and limitations on the number of runs. The models are based on a set of runs at selected inputs to aid in predicting the output at untried inputs, optimizing characteristics of the output, identifying important input factors and tuning the model to physical data. The strategies will be devised in the context of large numbers of input factors. The ingredients will include methods to select inputs (statistical experimental design) and to analyze the output data through the use of stochastic process models for deterministic outputs. Supercomputing power will be necessary to treat large numbers of factors and to extract the most out of an expensive-to-collect set of runs from computer models that themselves may run on supercomputers. A cross- disciplinary atmosphere will be maintained to stimulate the formulation of relevant problems with applicable solutions.\n",
      "a9001729 DMS $46100 The project of F. Connolly covers a variety of topics related to topological rigidity properties of crystallographic, arithmetic, and negatively curved groups. His investigations also include related questions about Nil-K-theory of such groups as well as the study of groups which act freely and cocompactly on the product of real n-space and an m-sphere. This work is related to a number of famous open problems, e.g., the Borel conjecture, the Novikov conjecture, and it draws upon a broad range of techniques.\n",
      "a9001730 INT $19860 This award supports cooperative research in enzyme biochemistry between William Stahl of the University of Washington in Seattle and Marta Antonelli of the Institute of Cellular Biology in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The study will examine the role of specific sequences of isoforms of the catalytic subunit of the Na,K-ATPase in ouabain binding. One important goal is to establish whether the C-terminus of the catalytic subunit is intracelular or extracellular. In addition, a long term goal is to establish localization of isoforms with different ouabain binding characteristics by light microscope immunocytochemistry. Dr. Antonelli has support for this work at the Institute through collaboration with its Director, Jorge Saavedra's immunocytochemistry group. The have extensive experience in light and electron microscope immunocytochemistry. Their methodologies have been utilized by Dr. Stahl in his laboratory. The collaboration will provide an opportunity to make use of the excellent facilities in Argentina for localization of the Na,K-ATPase isoforms to provide insight into the structure of the cardiac glycoside binding site in different isoforms of the catalytic subunit. This is complementary to studies in Seattle on expression of mRNAs coding for isoforms with high and low affinities for cardiac glycosides. Brought together in this collaboration, these efforts will provide a broader, more comprehensive approach to understanding functional aspects of Na,K-ATPases.\n",
      "a9001733 DMI $270431 The purpose of this research is to develop a novel, efficient technique of noncontacting laser phased array generation of ultrasound, for the nondestructive evaluation (NDE) of solids and processes. The new technique uses an array of laser beams in place of a single beam. The research will include a basic study to evaluate the performance of and develop an analytical model for the phased array. Specific applications to noncontact NDE on-line control of the depth of penetration and porosity during a gas metal arc welding (GMAW) process will be pursued. An electromagnetic acoustic transducer will be used as a noncontact receiver. The research has five phases as follows: (1) development of an analytical model for predicting the generation of ultrasound by a laser phased array; (2) experimental verification of the model for the phased array; (3) application of phased array to noncontact NDE on-line control of the depth of weld pool penetration and porosity; (4) development of an analytical model for propagation of sound through the weld pool; and (5) development of the data acquisition system and algorithms. The information on weld pool penetration and porosity extracted from the ultrasonic signal will be used in the system feedback for the welding power-supply, current, or speed control, to achieve the desired penetration and porosity.\n",
      "a9001734 DMS $42100 The principal investigator will study the problems of smoothing parameter (bandwidth) selection for nonparametric models, and order selection for linear models. Nonparametric and linear models have been used extensively in many fields. Although there are many procedures available for selecting the bandwidth or the order, it is recognized that the classical selectors are subject to large sample variation, and thus may not be very useful in practice. Recently, using the technique of Fourier analysis, the investigator proposed some stabilized procedures to reduce the variation in selecting the bandwidth for kernel regression of density estimation. This project will follow the approach recently obtained by the investigator to study the bandwidth or order selection problems for several important cases, which include boundary effects, random design points, order selection for autoregressive processes, extraction of periodic components, point processes, and robust smoothers.\n",
      "a9001735 DMS $26374 The goal of this research is to understand the behavior of solutions of nonlinear partial differential equations by using asymptotic methods of singular perturbation type. Two kinds of problems will be investigated: the slow crossing of a separatrix due to a weak dissipative perturbation and the development of a method of averaging for slowly varying waves influenced by weak perturbations. Such equations arise in a host of areas where the behavior of nonlinear waves is the primary physical process. Many phenomena in nature involve the action of weakly nonlinear waves. Examples include the motion of the tides as well as the daily bodily rhythms of waking and sleeping. Such complex systems can be approximated sometimes by systems of partial differential equations that contain one or more small parameters. In this research the principal investigator will use the smallness of these parameters to construct approximate solutions of the equations by replacing the complicated equations with simpler ones. The simpler equations still retain the essential physics of the complicated ones, but they are much easier to study.\n",
      "a9001736 DMS $63350 The research on this grant concerns the global structure theory for arbitrary infinite semigroups. Applications will be given to formal languages, infinite group theory, and decision problems. The mathematical development will consist of the following: general machinery, the kernel of a morphism between semigroups, expansions, the prime decomposition theorem for arbitrary semigroups and applications. This research is in the area of semigroups. A semigroup is one of the simplest of the abstract mathematical structures, consisting of a set with one associative operation on it. The structure of these very general objects will be investigated. Applications will be given to various areas of mathematics and computer science.\n",
      "a9001737 DMS $92404 This project involves research in ergodic theory. Ergodic theory in general concerns understanding the average behavior of systems whose dynamics is too complicated or chaotic to be followed in microscopic detail. Under the heading \"dynamics\" can be placed the modern theory of how groups of abstract transformations act on smooth spaces. In this way ergodic theory makes contact with geometry in its quest to classify flows on homogeneous spaces. Professor Ratner is a world leader in ergodic theory. She will continue her work on the \"rigidity\" of unipotent subgroups of connected Lie groups. In particular, she will attempt to prove a conjecture of Raghunathan which states that every such subgroup is \"algebraic\". Such a result would have important implications for the diverse fields of ergodic theory, geometry, and number theory.\n",

These samples will be compared in detail with a corresponding suite of samples collected from the same locality just prior to the passage of Hurricane Hugo, and will provide a unique opportunity to assess directly the impact of a major storm on several aspects of post-mortem skeletal alteration and transport. Research will assess the role of storms in the formation of sedimentary strata and fossil accumulations.\n",
      "a9001744 PHY $68927 Research on a wide variety of phenomenological and theoretical topics in particle physics will be carried out. Two theoretical projects evaluating the cross-sections fortriple weak gauge boson and S- and P-state (and even D-state)quarkonium production are planned. Several more phenomenological calculations involving psi and chi production invarious collider settings are envisaged. Further work on tests of the hadronic (especially the gluonic) structure functions of the photon in ep collisions will also be undertaken, as will projects at the interface of particle physics with astrophysics and cosmic ray physics. Much of the work to be carried out is meant to further the extremely crucial contact between theoretical and experimental elementary particle physics.\n",
      "a9001747 ATM $50046 The quality of forecasts made with numerical prediction models degrades during the numerical integration due to systematic errors, that is, errors that are related to the model's formulation. Preliminary studies done with the Community Climate Model (CCM) of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) indicate that horizontal resolution may be a critical factor in the evolution and structure of planetary scale waves which are simulated by the CCM. The goal of this research project is to determine the role of model resolution in systematic error. It will be accomplished through simulations of five winter periods and several forecast experiments. The results will have important implications for improving both extended range weather forecasts (up to 30 days) and climate models. This project represents a collaboration between Dr. T.-C. Chen, the principal investigator, and Dr. Joseph Tribbia, an NCAR scientist.\n",

The study will include both the development of the underlying mathematical theory of queues (such as the fundamental M/G/1 model, vacation models, cyclic- service models and multiserver systems with ordered hunt) and the practical application to the performance analysis for real systems.\n",
      "a9001753 PHY $45000 Work on two kinds of nonclassical states is proposed. The first are states whose phase is correlated with their ampli- tude. States of this kind can be detected by measuring their noise after they have passed through a Kerr medium. The objective is to develop a formalism for describing the phase/amplitude correlations for such states. The second set of states to be studied are the so called squeezed states. In particular, those states which are squeezed in the mode ampli- tudes (quadratic squeezing). Three basic forms of quadratic squeezing have already been examined and it is proposed to study the nature of mixed forms of these states. Here, non-linear interactions can transform different types of quadratically squeezed states among themselves. These trans- formations will be studied in some detail in the proposal.\n",
      "a9001755 IBN $255000 Myxococcus xanthus development is regulated by the Csg intercellular communication system. The C signal appears to be the polypeptide product of the csgA gene. The preliminary results suggest four directions for future work. First, random mutagenesis of csgA followed by DNA sequencing of developmental mutants is expected to determine the important functional domains of the protein. Second, examination of the regulation of csgA in response to moderated levels of nutrients is expected to reveal how nutrient levels are assessed in this organism and used to regulate gene expression. This project will involve a) random mutagenesis and DNA sequencing of the regulatory region to identify nucleotides that play a critical role in regulation, b) cloning of genes encoding regulatory proteins using recognition site probes, c) characterization of the protein-DNA interactions with gel mobility shift assays and DNA foot printing, and d) quantitation of the expression levels in vivo using a reporter locus. Third, continued analysis of the csgA suppressor mutations is expected to reveal other steps in the signaling process. Several suppressor alleles have been cloned and these will be sequenced and studied by other functional assays. %%% The life cycle of the myxobacterium, Myxococcus xanthus, contains the basic elements found in the development of higher organisms including directed cell movement, multicellular morphogenesis, regulated gene expression and cellular differentiation. It can therefore serve as an experimentally accessible model for the study of these processes.\n",
      "a9001756 IIS $182452 Appoaches to acquiring problem-solving knowledge have focused on achieving general results with simple problem domains. These domains have had small search spaces, few subgoal interactions, and only Boolean constraints. Real-world application domains have many subgoal interactions, large search spaces, and real- valued performance constraints as well as Boolean constraints. SteppingStone is a new general learning problem solver for solving difficult real-world problems. SteppingStone solves these problems by decomposing them into simpler subproblems, and then learning to deal with the interactions that arise between them. An initial version of our approach demonstrates this in the classical tile-sliding domain. This work will extend the system and demonstrate its capability in real-world problem- solving situations such as VLSI design and job-shop scheduling. By experimenting with both classical problem-solving domains and real-world aplications it will demonstrate that the problem solver is both powerful and general.\n",
      "a9001757 INT $7225 This award will provide supplementary support to enable Dr. Jaxk Reeves of the University of Georgia to conduct collaborative research for 12 months with Dr. Masami Hasegawa of the Institute of Statistical Mathematics in Tokyo, Japan. Using the complete mitochondrial genome of several completely sequenced animal species (human, cow, mouse, frog, fruit fly), the researchers will apply statistical techniques to obtain estimates and standard errors thereof of the long-term substitution rates of the elemental DNA bases (A,C,G,T). In addition, they will obtain estimates and standard errors of the relative time-distances between various species' branchings. The approach to be used is novel in that the complete mitochondrial DNA genome of five animal species will be used; approximately 16,500 base pairs for each. This will allow the researchers to address the questions of whether the rate of specific base pair substitution has been approximately constant over the millions of years of evolutionary history, and what effect position in the sequence has on substitution rates. Dr. Hasegawa is an established leader in the application of statistics to the field of genetics, and the Institute of Statistical Mathematics should prove an ideal environment for Dr. Reeves to pursue and expand his research.\n",
      "a9001758 INT $4650 This award will provide supplementary support to enable Dr. Elizabeth Klerman of the Harvard Medical School to conduct collaborative research for 12 months with Dr. K. Aihara of Tokyo Denki University, Japan. They will investigate the significance of chaos in neural information processing by analyzing the characteristics of artificial neural networks composed of neurons with chaotic dynamics. The nonlinear phenomena of deterministic chaos is now recognized as ubiquitous in fields such as feedback systems, optics, ecology and biological systems. This project will attempt to demonstrate the effects of chaotic fluctuations in applications of network and neurocomputing. For example, since chaotic neurons can produce macroscopic fluctuations spontaneously, they may provide a means of escaping from undesirable local minima in problems of optimiza- tion, learning and self organization. Dr. Aihara's background in mathematical modeling of chaotic neurons will complement Dr. Klerman's research experience in the area of circadian rhythms.\n",
      "a9001759 IBN $234000 Two broad aims of this research are to determine (1) the pathways followed by sugars manufactured in the photosynthesizing cells (mesophyll cells) of the leaf to the food-conducting cells (sieve-tube members) of the leaf veins, and (2) the sites at which the sugars are actively secreted, or loaded, and unloaded in mature (source) and immature (sink) leaves, respectively. Detailed structural studies, with light and electron microscopes, are complemented by experimental studies, including localization of 14C-labeled sugars within the leaf by microautoradiography; plasmolysis studies designed to determine the solute (primarily sugar) concentrations of the various cell types; and the use of fluorescent dyes to determine whether substances move from cell to cell via cytoplasmic connection in their walls (symplastic movement), via the cell wall continuum (apoplastic movement), or a combination of the two. The results of these studies will be of long-term practical importance in relation to crop productivity and will be of great value to investigators interested in relations of viruses, insects, mycoplasmas, and other parasites, and in the movement of insecticides and growth regulating substances in cultivated plants. Barley, maize, and soybean, species to be studied, are economically important plants.\n",
      "a9001760 DMS $30000 This research will focus on four areas: 1) integrability theory for linear differential systems and perturbation theory for the feedback linearization equations of nolinear control theory. This work will support the program of engineering research of nonlinear control of air-space-craft at NASA-Ames Research Center directed by Dr. George Meyer. This research was cited in the recent NSF Report on Control Theory as a prime example of the practical success of the application of geometric methodology. 2) Geometric and sheaf-theoretic methodology in the knowledge-representation and computation theory side of computer science. This will provide mathematical support for the Discrete Event System and Artificial Intelligence research. 3) Lie- theoretic methods in numerical analysis developing new geometric and Lie-theoretic methodology for the numerical algorithms of linear algebra and differential equations. 4) Infinite pseudogroups in elementary particle physics looking for the ntural mathematical synthesis of String and Standard Model gauge theories, utilizing the Cartan-Matshushima-Guillemin-Sternberg- Conn theory of structure of infinite Lie pseudogroups.\n",
      "a9001761 SES $84569 There has been much debate in recent years over whether countries will tend in the long run to converge to the same level of productivity which can be measured in terms of per capita income. In practice, the debate concerns the question of whether poor countries tend to have higher per capita income growth rates than rich ones, or put another way: is there a tendency for poor countries to \"catch up\"? The purpose of this research is to integrate data and growth theory to focus on the question of economic convergence. This project will involve an empirical and theoretical investigation of the causes of convergence or lack thereof. The approach taken to the question of catching up begins by restating the question as one concerning the effects of initial conditions on subsequent growth. It is the contention in this study that initial per capita income is too aggregate a measure of initial conditions on which to base our expectations of a country's subsequent growth. By disaggregating initial conditions in a growth-theoretic context it is possible to greatly improve our understanding of why some poor countries have grown much faster than rich countries while others have note. This project is important because it will provide new insights about the prospects for economic growth in the less developed countries.\n",
      "a9001762 AST $237930 This investigation, by one of the leaders in the field of cosmo- logical modeling, combines two approaches to the basic problem of understanding the origin of large-scale structure in our uni- verse. The first approach is to work out the consequences of theoretical models using N-body simulations with far greater dynamic range than any previously performed, spanning at least 7.5 orders of magnitude in mass and 3 in distance. With more than 100 times as many particles as nearly all previous cosmolog- ical simulations, this project is expected to yield much improved tests of the inflationary universe paradigm with dark matter and biased galaxy formation. The second approach will investigate the theoretical implications of large-scale deviations from uniform Hubble expansion. A newly developed technique will be applied to galaxy redshift-distance samples to reconstruct the three-dimensional potential, velocity, and mass density fields. Possible systematic errors will be closely investigated with the goal of deriving more accurate relative galaxy distances.\n",
      "a9001770 DMR $204800 The subject of this research is to investigate the basic physics of polymer gels, in particular their moleculer and microscopic structure, the kinetics of gelation, and the diffusion of particles and polymers in gels. The problem of probe diffusion in gels has a direct bearing on the practical problems of electrophoresis, and on the fundamental problem of polymer diffusion in random media. The primary experimental tools that will be used are static and dynamic laser light scattering. An investigation of the vibrational dynamics of gels using inelastic neutron scattering and Raman spectroscopy is also proposed. The experimental work will be complemented by computer simulations of gels. This effort should lead to a better understanding of the properties gels as materials.\n",

      "a9001777 DMS $144000 The principal investigator will study rods, shells and solid bodies composed of various elastic, plastic and viscous materials using geometrically exact theories for nonlinear constitutive equations, in order to treat new nonlinear effects, thresholds and instabilities. He will study also dissipative mechanisms in solid materials such as shock waves and contact discontinuities. Two-and three-dimensional solid bodies are complicated objects to study when they are composed of elastic or plastic material. The reason is that such objects often behave counter- intuitively when subjected to loading or stress. In order to help understand these materials and predict their responses to applied forces it is important to have mathematical models that are realistic and at the same time amenable to solution. This proposal will formulate several such models and attempt to find meaningful solutions.\n",
      "a9001778 CCR $6500 Columbia University hosts two Theory Days annually, one in the spring and one in the fall. Each theory day consists of four one-hour invited talks on current research results. In addition, there is ample time for questions and informal discussions on a range of theoretical topics. Typically 100-150 people attend. This project supports four theory days, beginning with the Spring 1990 theory day.\n",
      "a9001779 CCR $55915 Modern communication systems, for examples high speed pulse code transmission systems via satellite, impose a wide frequency band over which pulse amplitude and phase distortion must be contained within acceptable limits to preserve the integrity of the output information. The system includes many components whose mismatch, e.g. amplifiers with their fixed parasitic elements, contribute to the degradation of wide band response. Broadband equalizers must be properly inserted along the system to compensate for these inevitable mismatches that occur over the band so as to maintain low levels of distortion. This research deals with three difficult and important problems in broadband matching which are especially (though not exclusively) applicable to distributed gain-bandwidth (GBW) theory of linear passive and active 2-ports which arises in such applications as FET amplifiers where loss and internal feedback are included. Heretofore no complete analytic solution of this problem has been presented. The second considers new broadband matching methods which could give a practical approach to matching loads which are badly mismatched and/or have widely fluctuating input impedances as a function of frequency. Microwave antennas, microwave to optical device coupling structures, and microwave FET amplifiers including the parasitic elements due to packaging as well as those of the intrinsic device are typical applications. The third problem concerns gain-bandwidth performance and the design of coupling structures for multi-device distributed amplifiers using realistic models for the active devices.\n",
      "a9001784 DMS $96350 This research is concerned with probabilistic and generational properties of finite groups. In particular the structure of a random permutation group will be investigated. These results will be applied to algorithmic questions concerning permutation groups. The principal investigator will also consider properties of finite quotients of affine buildings associated with p-adic simple groups. In addition, the relationships among certain generalized quadrangles and certain translation planes will be considered. A group is an algebraic object having a single operation. This work is concerned with determining the generators of a finite group from a probabilistic standpoint. These questions arise directly from desired applications in contemporary computer science.\n",
      "a9001788 DMS $92284 This proposal is to continue research in several areas of nonlinear applied dynamics. Excitable systems---systems which can be triggered by a small stimulus---arise as models of several physiological and chemical phenomena. It is proposed to study such systems, with an emphasis on understanding the periodic and aperiodic behavior that is seen. Another project is studying models of polymerization reactors with multiple initiators, in collaboration with some chemical engineers. The emphasis is to model industrial processes as completely as possible and understand behaviors of reactors under different operating conditions so as to effect control, and in particular, prevent catastrophic runaway of reactors. It is also proposed to continue work on understanding the stability of standing-and travelling-wave solutions of parabolic differential equations.\n",
      "a9001790 DMS $68577 This project will make theoretical and numerical investigations of the nonlinear partial differential equations that describe structured models of cell population dynamics. Individual cells are distinguished by structure variables corresponding to size, age, or other physical characteristics. The populations are divided into population subclasses that interact through nonlinear transition rates. The main objective will be to understand the qualitative behavior of the populations, the on- set of oscillatory phenomena, and the response to external periodic loss functions. The main methods will apply the theory of semigroups of positive linear and nonlinear operators in Banach lattices. The main applications will be to tumor cell populations with proliferating and quiescent classes and to multi-level blood cell production systems. The goal in the tumor cell population studies will be to understand the role of quiescence in tumor growth and tumor therapy. The goal in the blood cell population studies will be to understand the regulation processes in normal and abnormal systems.\n",
      "a9001792 DMS $44680 This award provides additional support for research by a Presidential Young Investigator working on problems of Fourier analysis related to the microlocal analysis of partial differential operators and the theory of Fourier integral operators. Work will be done in developing a microlocal version of the maximal theorem of Bourgain. The result concerns the maximal operator associated with the Radon transform (over spheres) which was shown to preserve the Lebesgue spaces for powers greater than two. The averaging may be viewed as a Fourier integral operator of negative order one-half. Efforts will be made to determine if the same result holds for any family of nondegererate operators of the same order, depending smoothly on a linear parameter. Some additional conditions have to be established since a total generalization is known to be impossible. A related type of operator studied by Carleson and Sjolin is known to preserve the fourth-power Lebesgue spaces. In this project, work will be done in expanding the operators to integral transforms involving exponential of the Laplace-Beltrami operator. If this is possible then the Carleson-Sjolin theorem for Bochner-Riesz summation in the plane can be extended to compact manifolds. Other work involves the question of embedded eigenvalues for Schrodinger operators. If the potential is bounded by the reciprocal of the variable, then Hormander showed that eigenfunctions which are small at infinity actually vanish everywhere. The next step in analyzing this phenomenon is to determine exact conditions on the potential to guarantee the same result. An immediate goal will be to find the correct function space (one of the local Lebesgue spaces) for embedding the potential.\n",
      "a9001793 DMS $75975 Work to be done on this project falls into two related classes. The first, infinite dimensional nonlinear programming problems, concerns the modeling of optimal control problems for partial differential equations, functional differential equations and other equations as infinite dimensional nonlinear programming problems. Goals include developing necessary conditions for the existence of minima and for the convergence of sequences of suboptimal elements. The second theme, optimal control theory of partial differential and functional differential equations concerns application of results from the first part to problems such as optimal deformation problems - especially in the presence of obstacles. The results are likely to include versions of Pontryagin's maximum principle, constancy and vanishing of the Hamiltonian and convergence estimates. Attention will also be given to boundary control questions, where results (compared to distributed parameter systems) are sparse. Application to specific equations will be made.\n",
      "a9001794 DMS $124470 This research involves the quantum field theory of fermions on the Poincare disk and the hard hexagon model - a lattice gas model in statistical mechanics. The research on the quantum theory of fermions will involve expressing the Schwinger functions in terms of certain nonlinear deformation equations. These equations will then be analyzed both in the Euclidean limit and in the conformal field theory limit. An important aspect of this work is the extension of the existing theory to the noneuclidean setting which may lay the groundwork for extensions to Riemann surfaces of a more general type. The research on the hard hexagon model will involve derivations of differential equations for the partition function and density functions. An attempt will be made to extend these equations to the hard square lattice gas, a model that is 'not solvable' by present techniques. This research is in the general area of theoretical physics and deals with isomonodromy deformations and applications to conformal field theory, statistical mechanics, and scattering theory.\n",
      "a9001796 DMS $37398 Professor Montgomery-Smith will conduct research into the study of the cotype 2 constant of operators from C(K) to any Banach space. This is intended to fill a gap on what is already known about how cotype 2 relates to operators from C(K) which has so far dealt only with operators which factor through a space of cotype 2. This research will involve the study of Rademacher processes. This is a recent but very natural area. It takes as its starting point the well studied Gaussian processes. This research is at the interface of two fields: probability and operator theory on infinite dimensional spaces. Properties of operators (infinite dimensional matrices) are studied using ideas from probability and conversely the quest to understand these operators leads to new and interesting questions in pure probability.\n",
      "a9001801 DMS $42000 The principal investigator is currently addressing two areas of research. The first is the application of Casson-Gordon type invariants to problems in link concordance, and, in particular, to questions relating to boundary linking. A second area of research is the study of periodic knots and symmetries of manifolds. Both areas require the development of algebraic tools for describing knots and links and for distinguishing truly distinct knots and links from ones which are merely differently presented. Application of such tools to classify knots and links to within some natural equivalence is a major goal.\n",
      "a9001805 DMS $180000 This is a proposal to study mathematical models of physical phenomena arising in the flow of compressible and turbulent gases. In particular, the principal investigator will use analytical and numerical tools to investigate the instability of solutions of nonlinear systems of hyperbolic equations in three dimensions, the evolution of vortex filaments, the derivation of macroscopic transport quantities from turbulent flows using techniques of homogenization theory, and the properties of weak solutions of systems of equations from fluid dynamics and plasma physics. Various types of physical phenomena involve flows containing vortices. Everyday examples of vortices are tornadoes or the bath water as it goes down the drain. Mathematicians study the properties of such vortex motions by constructing simplified sets of equations that have \"vortex-like\" solutions and then using analytical and numerical methods to predict how these solutions evolve in time. The principal investigator will examine models of vortex flows that arise in aerodynamics and plasma physics.\n",
      "a9001807 DEB $49996 Hurricane Hugo struck the coast of South Carolina just after midnight on Friday, September 22, 1989. The eye of the hurricane came ashore just north of Charleston, SC and moved northward through the state to Charlotte, NC. Hugo's landfall was near the Baruch Institute's coastal field facility and the North Inlet Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) site. The site received extensive storm damage and a tidal surge that was 4 meters above mean high tide. Salt marsh ecosystems and their adjacent coastal forests have evolved under a regime of gradually rising sea level. A major hurricane such as Hugo may occur only 1-3 times per century. And this kind of disturbance may trigger sudden expansion of marsh into forested areas. To assess the short and long term effects of Hurricane Hugo, researchers at the University of South Carolina will: 1. Map the spatial distribution and elevation of the storm surge in the forested portion of the North Inlet ecosystem. And they will gather information on the storm surge height and the deposition of Spartina detritus (wrack) and marsh mud in the forest floor. 2. Map ground water salinity in forest soils, changes in soil and ground water chemistry, and relate this information to tree mortality and other changes in vegetation. 3. Establish study sites where decomposition of wrack and its effect on underlying soil can be studied. 4. Acquire low altitude, false-color infrared aerial photographs and multispectral Thematic Mapper (satellite) images to document geomorphic and botanical changes caused by Hugo. Follow-up photographs and satellite imagery should be made several times during the next several years to detect changes and recovery of the ecosystem. Work on effects of large disturbances such as Hurricane Hugo address important issues about the response, resilience, and recovery of complex coastal ecosystems. Information gathered by this research should provide data on mechanisms of salt marsh expansion and forest recession in response to salinity and wind stresses. And the work should provide valuable landscape level information on the response of the North Inlet LTER ecosystem to a major disturbance. Dr. Gardner is a very experienced and productive scientist who is well qualified to conduct and direct this research on the impacts of Hurricane Hugo on the North Inlet ecosystem. He will be assisted by Co-Principal Investigators, Kjerfve, Blood, Michener, and Williams. Although the Baruch Institute's field facilities were destroyed by Hugo, field research has continued. In particular, sampling transects and established piezometer networks facilitate the objectives of this research. The University of South Carolina has excellent facilities to support this research effort.\n",

      "a9001828 DEB $58800 Organisms as diverse as plants and primates respond differentially toward conspecifics according to their genetic relatedness. Differential treatment of kin is critical to current theories of the evolution of altruism and mate choice. Yet, in surprisingly few systems have investigators identified the selective factors responsible for the evolutionary maintenance of kin-biased behavior. For anuran tadpoles, the predominant view is that associating with relatives is kin- selected because these relatives thereby accrue benefits through increased growth or predation avoidance. Recent work, however, suggests that kin associations may reflect selection to associate with the natal site (philopatry), and perhaps not with kin per se. A series of field and laboratory experiments will be proposed, aimed at elucidating the adaptive significance of aggregation behavior in tadpoles. Specifically, this study proposes to determine whether 1) DNA fingerprinting reveals evidence of philopatry, 2) aggregation formation is advantageous, and 3) aggregation formation is context-dependent. The latter two issues will be addressed by conducting field experiments in natural ponds. This study will clarify the selective factors favoring kin association behavior in tadpoles and, by implication, in certain other gregarious organisms. Examination of context-dependent behavior provides opportunity to evaluate the role of assessment in evolutionary biology.\n",
      "a9001832 DEB $58800 The objective of the proposed study is to use molecular criteria to identify obligate or synergistic associations among members of a natural anaerobic microbial biofilm community under changing environmental conditions. To achieve this objective, comparative sequencing of environmentally derived 16s ribosomal RNAs and application of phylogenetically-based hybridization probes will be used to identify and monitor the dominant members of groundwater biofilm communities that are established within laboratory bioreactor systems. In conjunction with in situ hybridization techniques, this molecular framework will be used to define interdependent relationships among community members such as those involving H2-producing bacteria (fermentative and fatty acid-and alcohol-oxidizing bacteria) and H2-consuming bacteria (methanogenic bacteria and sulfate-reducing bacteria). Bioreactor operating conditions (eg. Substrate concentration and sulfate concentration) will be altered to detect these interdependent associations by following coordinate fluctuations among selected microbial populations (using the molecular approach described above) during biofilm colonization, development and establishment of the climax community. The proposed research should provide fundamental information regarding the diversity, stability and function of natural microbial communities. Such basic information about microbial communities has thusfar been inaccessible, but constitutes the foundation for studies of microbial ecosystem perturbation and assessment of the risk associated with the release of genetically engineered microorganisms into the environment.\n",

      "a9001848 OPP $105682 The Antarctic is now experiencing large springtime losses of stratospheric ozone, resulting in an increase in ultraviolet B (UVB, 280-320nm) radiation. The magnitude of ultraviolet radiation reaching the surface now approaches that measured in tropical latitudes. Perhaps more importantly, UVB radiation has increased in the Antarctic while both UVA (320-400nm) and photosynthetically available radiation (PAR, 400-700nm) have remained unchanged. Recent improvements in atmospheric modeling and technology in oceanographic instrumentation will be used in a six week field study during the austral spring 1990. The prime objective will be to document the impact of UV radiation on the phytoplankton community during the ice-edge spring bloom. During this time, oceanographic processes create favorable conditions for increased UVB susceptibility. Biological and bio-optical information will be used to define and quantify linkages between ozone-dependent oscillations in UV to PAR ratios and phytoplankton productivity. Special emphasis will be placed on defining biological restraints imposed by enhanced UVB and altered UVB:UVA:PAR ratios on the balance of UVB photodamage to photorepair, photoprotective and photosynthetic mechanisms operating in the Southern Ocean. The overall aim is to test the hypothesis that phytoplankton in Antarctic waters are adversely influenced by ozone depletion.\n",
      "a9001851 CMS $30000 Most transportation actions regarding disaster conditions cannot be tested or evaluated in a laboratory or inferred from normal situations. They have to be acquired through real-life events which in the case of an earthquake is a rare occurrence. The most significant events in the transportation and transportation related-field that followed the October 17, 1989 San Francisco Bay Area earthquake is the collapse of transportation facilities, particularly bridges, which caused discontinuity in the transportation network. These failures impacted several emergency management functions such as search and rescue, fire fighting and site evacuations. They also restricted the movement of people and goods among the various communities of the Bay Area. The main focus of this project is to study and assess the impacts of transportation system failures on emergency management functions and to evaluate the development and implementation of various traffic diversion strategies carried to provide accessibility and mobility to the travelers in the affected region. The developed strategies and models will enhance the work conducted after the Mexico City earthquake in this field, and test its applicability to the U.S. environment. The results will assist emergency managers and planners in the location and allocation of personnel and equipment, in the dispatch of emergency vehicles, and in the development of traffic diversion strategies that will avoid bottlenecks and minimize delays. They will also bring into focus the tremendous transportation costs incurred by business as well as by individuals as a result of the failure of key elements of the transportation network.\n",

The conference's aims include interaction between scientists from India, neighboring countries, Europe and the U.S., and encouragement of cooperative research. The program covers recent development in: squeezed states and nonclassical light; quantum theory of measurement and interferometers; cavity QED; photon statistics and optical phenomena; optical phenomena in superintense fields; topological places in nonlinear and quantum phenomena; coherence theory; laser cooling and trapping of ions and neutral atoms; new mechanism of laser action; resonance fluorescence; quantum jumps, optical bistability; and light induced drift. The Indian convener is Dr. G.S. Agarwal of the School of Physics, University of Hyderabad who is an active scientist in the field with a long record of successful collaborative research with U.S. scientists. The invited U.S. participants are eminently qualified and active scientists who can benefit from and contribute to the conference. Scope: This activity is beneficial to the Indian and U.S. scientists by enabling them to interact with colleagues from Europe and India, as well as develop cooperative activities between scientists of the two countries. It is likely the maximum benefits will be for scientists from smaller Indian universities who have few chances for such interaction.\n",
      "a9001857 DMS $68701 This project is focused on three areas of mathematical analysis: (1) periods of hyperelliptic Riemann surfaces and Hamiltonian mechanics, (2) matrix problems, and (3) long-time behavior of integrable systems. The first topic involves the investigation of a new connection between the arithmetic- geometric mean and the computation of hyperelliptic integrals on the one hand, and Hamiltonian mechanics on the other. The second topic involves the analysis of high accuracy algorithms to compute the singular values of a matrix. This part of the project is also concerned with the problem of computing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of products of matrices. A central role in the analysis is played by integrable Hamiltonian systems which interpolate the iterates of the singular value / eigenvalue algorithms at integer times. The third topic involves an analysis of the long-time behavior of integrable systems, specifically of the Toda shock problem. Attention will be focused on the case of low shock speed, the more general case for higher shock speeds, the stability problem in which a doubly infinite Toda lattice in equilibrium is perturbed locally, the question of the rate and the manner in which the eigenvalues fill the \"phantom\" band, and the analysis of the long-time behavior of the nonlinear wave equations in the Gel'fand-Dikii hierarchy. The work in this project deals with spectral problems and inverse spectral problems. The project is concerned with applications to Hamiltonian mechanics, with the development of algorithms which improve the accuracy of the computed singular values of a matrix, and with the study of the long-time behavior of integrable systems.\n",

Hypothesis tests and confidence intervals as well as estimators will be studied. Mixed effects and random effects models are to be studied as well as fixed effects models. Specifically, a new analysis of variance table with three additional \"mean squares\" per line will be given based on high-breakdown, high-efficientcy estimates of effects and of scale. The new mean squares will provide information on unusual aspects of the data. Also the robust scale problem will be studied and robust methods for variance components will be given.

      "a9001861 DMS $47650 The principal investigator will study the existence of compact leaves in contact foliations of compact contact manifolds. The existence of these foliations was conjectured by Weinstein. Several special cases have been solved by this investigator and by other mathematicians. Lickorish surgical techniques will be used to investigate the three-dimensional version of the problem. Okumura's theory will be applied to the problem in the case of hypersurfaces with contact types in Kaehler manifolds. Diffeomorphism groups will also be studied. \"Manifolds\" are generalized surfaces. These may be filled with collections of lower dimensional \"leaves.\" Such collections of leaves are called \"foliations.\" The principal investigator will study leaves which do not wrap on continuously but actually close up. These are called in the literature, \"compact leaves.\" Such are particularly important in applications to other sciences in that they represent, in a general sense, behavior which repeats indefinitely.\n",

Both theoretical and applied statistical issues are addressed: new spatial stochastic models will be built, parameter estimators will be developed, inference results for those estimators will be proved, and scientific applications on real data will be featured. This work will have impact on various fields such as earth sciences, geography, oceanography, hydrology, and environmetrics.\n",

      "a9001872 CTS $331358 The fabrication of integrated circuits involves the creation of patterned, multilayer, thin film structures composed of insulators, semiconductors, and conductors. Typically, these structures are constructed by using photolithographic techniques in conjunction with additional processing steps, including chemical vapor deposition (CVD), etching, doping, etc. Some of these steps (e.g., wet etching) lack sufficient resolution for high density devices, while others (e.g., high temperatures in CVD) subject the wafer to extreme conditions that may damage underlying structures. Furthermore, patterning of thin films by lithography involves several complex processing steps (e.g. spin-on bake, expose, develop, etch, photo-resist strip) which increase the chance of defects. This has led researchers in the semiconductor industry to investigate laser processing of microelectronic devices. The repair of mask sets by depositing or etching a feature and customizing of electronic packages as other applications where laser processing is expected to have a considerable impact. Research in laser processing has resulted in an array of novel micro-chemical processing techniques. This PI's research program focuses on laser induced deposition. The process of scanning a laser beam across a substrate, causing reactants in either the gas, liquid or solid phase to react and deposit on the substrate is commonly referred to as laser direct-writing. This research project is a combined experimental and modelling study of the fundamental mechanisms underlying nonlinear morphological effects in direct laser writing of metal and semiconductor lines from spun-on metalorganic layers as well as by CVD. The experimental system consists of a microscope for focusing radiation from an argon laser onto a substrate. An x-y translation stage moves the substrate relative to the laser beam so that lines may be written. The nonlinear behavior to be investigated includes multiplicity phenomena, periodic patterns, and volcano-shaped deposits. These effects are observed over a wide range of operating conditions in a large number of applications including the deposition of gold from organogold films, silicon from silane, and yttrium- barium-copper-oxygen superconductors from spun-on metalorganic films. The overall goals of this coordinated experimental and modelling research program are to understand the underlying fundamental processes and to develop predictive models that may be used to prevent or control the nonlinear behavior. This will be critical to the further development of laser direct-write systems that will have to face new applications and meet increasingly stringent specifications on feature size in order to satisfy the needs of future microelectronics and micromechanical processing.\n",

      "a9001876 CHE $295000 This grant is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the subfield of laser spectroscopy of liquid solid interfaces. Professor Robert Corn will develop the theoretical and experimental description of monolayers of mixed molecular species at metal electrode interfaces. The second harmonic generation and sum frequency generation methods developed by Professor Corn will be combined with infrared spectroscopic measurements of mixed monolayers of molecular species controlled by electrochemical potential on a metal electrode. These studies will allow fuller understanding of the role of interfacial molecular structure on electron transfer processes which occur at these interfaces. In addition, the methodology will allow more complete description of other liquid solid interfaces of import in a variety of chemical and technological processes. By combining second harmonic generation (SHG) on and off resonance analysis and theoretical description of the response using Pople-Pariser-Parr formalism to describe the molecular polarizability tensors, the first measurements of molecular orientation response in SHG have been made. Professor Corn will extend these measurements in combination with infrared reflection absorption and sum frequency generation to fully characterize mixed monolayers of molecular species at single crystal electrode liquid interfaces.\n",
      "a9001878 DMS $104300 This award supports the research in automorphic forms of Professor Don Blasius of the University of California at Los Angeles. Dr. Blasius's project is to complete the construction of Galois representations for Maass forms of Galois type by extending to coherent cohomology certain methods of interpre- tation that have been established for holomorphic forms; to stabilize the Trace Formula for GSp(4), beginning with the Fundamental Lemma; and to study certain lifting problems involving Abelian varieties, in the setting of Shimura varieties, applying his work on p-adic properties of Hodge classes. Non-Euclidean plane geometry began in the early nineteenth century as a mathematical curiosity, but by the end of that century, mathematicians had realized that many objects of fundamental importance are non-Euclidean in their basic nature. The detailed study of non-Euclidean plane geometries has given rise to several branches of modern mathematics, of which the study of modular and automorphic forms is one of the most active. This field is principally concerned with questions about the whole numbers, but in its use of geometry and analysis, it retains connection to its historical roots.\n",
      "a9001881 DMS $46100 The principal investigator will complete the study of two- generator subgroups of PSL(2,R). The investigation will result in a complete and unified account of the geometric and algebraic approaches to this classification problem, as well as a complete description of the relationship between this algebra and geometry. The investigator will also study an extension of these methods to the complex numbers and to several real variables. The work to be completed by the principal investigator has as one of its ramifications the complete understanding of tilings of the plane by tiles invariant under some sort of discrete group action. These have been of interest to mathematicians for more than a century and their study was recently revived by W. Thurston. Connections between this investigation and the topology of three dimensional hypersurfaces as well as to dynamical systems, abound.\n",
      "a9001883 DMS $127501 Mathematical research undertaken in this project follows two related themes, both within the context of functions of several complex variables. The first is concerned with the question of removable singularities. There is a significant change in the phenomenon of singularities as soon as one goes from one to several variables. Points or sets where holomorphic functions may be extended as holomorphic functions are called removable singularities. One of the goals of this continuing work is to characterize removable singularities by means of the algebra of functions defined in neighborhoods of the singularities. In examples which have been worked out, when the singular set is convex with respect to the algebra, it is removable. A related question to be taken up concerns the characterization of smooth manifolds in the boundary of a domain which are removable. The second thrust of the project concerns the boundary values of holomorphic functions. Two points of view prevail. One is to determine whether a smooth function on the boundary continues holomorphically to the interior, the other is concerned with the question of the extent to which a holomorphic function on the interior extends to the boundary in some reasonable fashion. In the former case, work will concentrate on efforts to determine whether functions which can be continued holomorphically along lower dimensional manifolds, complex lines for example, are holomorphic in the large. Boundary considerations lead naturally to applications of geometric analysis, while the extension theory is closely tied with that of solving systems of partial differential equations.\n",

This is a high risk effort with a large payoff if successful. If it works at a reasonable rate, the transformation of Drosophila will be greatly simplified if not become routine.\n",
      "a9001891 DMS $25950 The principal investigator will use his characterization of the Kobayashi metric on smoothly bounded convex domains to study the asymptotic behavior of this metric at a boundary. The ultimate goal is to solidify the relationship between complex function theory on the domain and the geometry of the boundary. In a second project he will study the global properties of contact structures on manifolds of dimension three. Topological invariants of the contact structure will be constructed analytically. Many of the most significant theorems in geometric analysis relate geometric and topological invariants. One of the earliest of these was the relationship between the total Gaussian curvature of a smooth surface and its numbers of tubes and cross caps. In the present project, the principal investigator will relate global Riemannian contact structures to the base topology of the manifold.\n",
      "a9001895 DMS $57250 Bonahon will study limit sets of Kleinian groups and of hyperbolic groups. A Kleinian group is a discrete group of isometries of hyperbolic 3-space. Bonahon intends to study the topological type of the limit set of a Kleinian group and show that it is determined by the algebraic structure of the group together with certain geometric invariants of the associated quotient space. He also wants to study the asymptotic behavior of the leaves of foliations of hyperbolic 3-space which are invariant under a Kleinian group (namely lifts of foliations of hyperbolic 3-manifolds) and to analyze how fast these leaves approach the limit set of the group. Following Gromov's terminology, a hyperbolic group is a finitely generated group which has certain growth properties similar to those of a cocompact Kleinian group. Such a hyperbolic group has a well defined limit set, also called its boundary. Bonahon wants to analyze how certain topological properties of the limit set of a hyperbolic group are related to algebraic properties of the group, involving in particular its outer automorphism group and decompositions into amalgamated products. Advances in the study of 3-dimensional manifolds in recent years, following work of Thurston, has rather surprisingly shown the extreme relevance of hyperbolic geometry to the understanding of the structure of 3-manifolds.\n",
      "a9001897 DMS $102250 The two principal investigators will study the isolation of a geometric aspect of integrability, singularity analysis of Toda equations and stratification of Bruhat cells, solutions to the sine-Gordon equations involving constant mean curvature tori immersed in spheres, and the universal enveloping algebra associated with properties of Poisson brackets. This project concerns deep properties of Hamiltonian systems. These are systems of differential equations which describe in particular the motion of mechanical devices. Such devices must conserve both energy and momentum. Recently, various algebraic methods as well as Painleve analysis of integrability has been used to make considerable progress toward the understanding of such systems. This project will contribute to these developments.\n",

      "a9001936 IIS $131370 The best current programs for two-person perfect information games play only a single game; they search exhaustively and they do not learn. The goals of this project are to demonstrate further the viability of a weak theory as a search paradigm and to facilitate the construction of computers that learn entire categories of tasks, rather than requiring individualized instruction. This research develops a program, HOYLE, that can play any such game correctly and, with experience, can learn to play it extremely well. Instead of extensive search, HOYLE learns a search control strategy for each new game under the guidance of its weak domain theory: a combination of procedural knowledge about game playing, declarative knowledge about specific games, a language and framework for strategic elements, and a set of narrow but expert perspectives called Advisors. As it plays a new game, HOYLE selectively constructs, organizes, and reformulates a knowledge base for each game from its playing experience. Under a novel architecture that employs a variety of control strategies for move selection, HOYLE combines that knowledge base with its Advisors to produce a coherentr, incisive, steadily improving strategy for the game. A prototype of this multifaceted learning has proved itself remarkably effective in a varied but limited domain. HOYLE addresses, both in its design and in its implementation, important questions in theory formation, collaboratin of experts, conflict resolution, experimental design, and operationalization.\n",
      "a9001940 DMI $232640 This phase 2 SBIR proposal is concerned with a new device which utilizes a technique developed for an ink-jet writing machine. This device should allow the delivery of very small amounts of fluid in the close proximity of a cell. Cells communicate with each other by secreting chemical messengers, such as hormones and neurotransmitters and it would be important, both for theoretical and practical purposes, to be able to replicate this process. This device promises to do precisely that. If the design is successfully implemented it will be possible to deliver minute amounts of chemicals known or suspected to be cellular messengers, directly onto the surface of cells.

Selberg (for the trace of the action of a Hecke correspondence on the L2 cohomology of a Hermitian locally symmetric space) will be reproved and interpreted in terms of the Lefschetz fixed point theorem. This will involve a new evaluation of the local contribution to the Lefschetz number at a fixed point and the construction of a new cohomology theory (\"weighted cohomology\") on the reductive Borel-Serre compactification of X. Applications will be made to the computation of characters of discrete series representations, the cohomology of discrete groups, and the Hodge (p,q) decomposition of the L2 cohomology. (2) Chern numbers of singular complex algebraic varieties will be defined by lifting Chern classes to intersection cohomology. The invariance properties of these new Chern numbers will be investigated.\n",

      "a9001956 DMS $466038 Five investigators will study related problems involving various aspects of differential geometry, algebraic varieties, and dynamical systems. The first will study variational problems arising from curvature considerations. The second will study isospectral deformations, optimal structures on Riemannian manifolds, and fibrations of spheres by great spheres. The third will investigate Einstein metrics, isotropic irreducible Riemannian manifolds, and the isotropy representation of symmetric spaces. A topologist will study stratified spaces, particularly algebraic varieties. And the fifth will study hyperbolic geometry in higher dimensions, representations of braid groups, link groups, and invariant links. A central goal of the differential geometers working on this project is to understand spacial curvature. In particular they will study the relationship between curvature and the overall shape of the space, or what sorts of functions may exist on the space. The topologist and dynamical systems theorist will use their understanding of the shape of the space and allowable dynamical properties to restrict curvature in various ways.\n",
      "a9001957 DMS $92420 The principal investigator will study global invariants on strictly pseudoconvex manifolds that arise as renormalized Chern classes for complete Kaehler metrics. He will continue his study of pseudodifferential operator calculi adapted to the study of degenerate operators similiar to the Bergman-Laplace operator. A goal will be to obtain index formulae relating the renormalized Chern numbers to \"analytic\" indices for degenerate elliptic complexes. And he will continue an investigation of the problem of embedding three dimensional CR-manifolds. For many years mathematicians have studied the behavior of certain differential operators on hypersurfaces which extend off to infinity. This study has its origins in the calculus of Newton. In this project the principal investigator will analyze operators which have large variations over very large domains \"near\" infinity. In the past, only progress on operators which have small local variations was made.\n",
      "a9001958 EID $76553 This program is designed to attract undergraduate, particularly women and minorities, into lasers and optics research, with emphasis on lightwave technology as an emerging technology. Many recent studies, including the National of Academies recent report on Photonics, identify this as one of the key technical growth areas of the future. Inspiration for these students to continue into graduate school will come from participating in research projects within the interdisciplinary Center for Laser Studies. This research organization is unusual for its large percentage of women and minorities, both on its staff and in its graduate student population. In 1989 the Center received REU site funding and developed a very successful program which included three Chicanos, two females and one black student. This gives the Center a chance to better recruit minority and women undergraduates and to provide more opportunity to participate in research, inspiring them to continue in graduate students. The projects include noise properties of semiconductor arrays, characterization of nonlinear services, fabrication and characterization of heterojunction lasers, solid stat lasers, fiber- optics power-by-light headset, and thermal transport in thin films.\n",
      "a9001959 DMS $41089 Professor Iozzi will conduct research in the application of ergodic theory to the study of group actions on manifolds or more generally on measure spaces. In particular she will apply techniques from this area, as well as methods of representation theory and the theory of algebraic groups, to a variety of questions involving connected transformation groups and their discrete subgroups. Examples of such questions are invariance phenomena for geometric structures and related issues on the compactification of algebraic varieties, orbit equivalence of actions, and the structural study of the diffeomorphism group of a manifold. This project involves research in ergodic theory. Ergodic theory in general concerns understanding the average behavior of systems whose dynamics is too complicated or chaotic to be followed in microscopic detail. Under the heading \"dynamics\" can be placed the modern theory of how groups of abstract transformations act on smooth spaces. In this way ergodic theory makes contact with geometry in its quest to classify flows on homogeneous spaces.\n",

      "a9001963 INT $13716 This award supports cooperative research in chemical process control to be conducted by Ahmet Palazoglu of the University of California at Davis and Jose Ramagnoli of the Chemical Engineering Pilot Plant of CONICET in Bahia Blanca, Argentina. The primary object of this collaborative effort is to develop design and analysis methods for robust process control systems. With increasing demands on product quality, contraints on process economics and stringent environmental regulations, automatic control has undeniably become and integral pat of chemical process operations. However, reliable under various operating regimes and demand that the controllers respond to such variations without loss of performance or stability characteristics. The methods developed through this collaboration will be tested on various applications. The U. S. investigators have already investigated a high purity distillation column model to demonstrate the uncertainty characterization by various methods. The dynamic model of double effect high purity column has also been developed and its behavior has been tested under multi-loop PI control. The research team in Argentina has studied the singular value and the structured singular value concepts in characterizing model uncertainty for chemical processes. These two groups have complementary expertise in the area of robust control of linear and nonlinear process. Demonstrated by a number of publications, the two linear process. Demonstrated by a number of publications, the two groups have investigated the use of various representations of the model/plant mismatch and arrived at design and analysis methods. The UC Davis group emphasizes the use of mag- nitude/phase information as well as its extensions to highly structured cases. In terms of applications, the UC Davis group developed rigorous dynamic models of high purity distillation systems while the Argentines work with triple effect evaporators and fixed-bed reactors, including pilot plant studies. Development of robust control strategies ultimately benefits processing industries in both countries by assisting them to operate process units with more confidence under tight control situations.\n",

She will also investigate the Yang-Mills functional in dimensions larger than four. A third investigator will study the knot types of periodic orbits in the Lorenz attractor. Three investigators will continue ongoing projects involved in differential equations, topology, and mathematical physics. Differential equations relate the rate of change of one or more variables with respect to each other, or with respect to time. Topology is the mathematical study of shape.

      "a9001983 INT $14362 This award will support collaborative work between Professor Mihir Sen of the University of Notre Dame and Professor Eduardo Ramos of the Solar Energy Laboratory in Temixco, Mexico. The researchers intend to study nucleate boiling from single-and multiple capillary sites. Variable heat flux will be used as a control parameter to analyze the sequence of bifurcations leading from periodic boiling up to chaos. In order to assess the contribution of phase change to the observed phenomena, a similar study without phase change, but with the controlled injection of an inert gas, will also be carried out. In this case the mass flow rate of the inert gas will be the relevant bifurcation parameter. The bulk of the phase change work will be done in the U.S., while most of the inert gas studies will be in Mexico. One part of the work will consist of extensive observation and interpretation of an experimental nature. Another will be the development of a suitable analytical model for the processes which can qualitatively explain the observed phenomena. Though the cylindrical capillary structure chosen for study is the simplest geometry from a basic point of view, results from this study are expected to advance our fundamental understanding of boiling. As such the proposed work has potential application to the design of thermal equipment operating under boiling conditions and to the preparation of structured surfaces for enhanced heat transfer.\n",
      "a9001985 IBN $307000 The proposed studies concern the mechanisms and the regulation of those mechanisms whereby the kidneys excrete water, inorganic substances, and organic substances. They involve the regulation of the rate of production of a filtrate of the blood and the mechanisms by which organic and inorganic substances are moved across renal tubule cells, either from the initial filtrate back into the blood perfusing these cells or from the blood perfusing these cells into the initial filtrate. The organic substances being studied are those that exist as positively charged molecules (primarily the exogenous nerve blocking agent, tetraethylammonium, and the endogenous product of nicotinic acid metabolism, N1-methylnicotinamide) and those that exist as negatively charged molecules (primarily the exogenous compound, p- aminohippurate, and the endogenous end product of nitrogen metabolism, urate). These studies take advantage of the relatively simple kidneys of reptiles in which the movement (or some characteristic of the movement) of some substances across the tubule cells is more pronounced than in mammals, and the complex kidneys of birds, which in part resemble the kidneys of reptiles and in part resemble the kidneys of mammals. The experimental approach is an integrative one that explores function at the membrane cell, and whole organ levels. These studies are important for understanding the way in which the kidneys permit animals to survive in specific environments and to adapt to changing environments. This understanding is particularly important in terms of adopting strategies to insure the survival of animal populations in the face of major changes in the earth's environment. Such strategies may also be important to human populations. These studies will also provide substantial insight into the way in which the kidneys in wild or domestic animals populations handle organic environmental pollutants, including many toxic compounds. This understanding applies also to human kidneys, not only in terms of normally toxic substances but also in terms of therapeutic agents that can be toxic when present in excess. Finally, these studies will provide information on the way in which the kidneys eliminate urate, an important substance in renal stone formation in humans and other animals. //\n",

      "a9002001 INT $17800 This award supports cooperative research in cell biology to be conducted by Paul Lazarow of Mt. Sinai School of Medicine in New York collaborating with Manuel Santos of the Catholic University in Santiago, Chile. The research will involve the study of subcellular organelles, peroxisomes, that participate in lipid metabolism and cellular respiration. The peroxisomal proteins seem to be formed from pre-existing organelles by synthesis on free ribosomes and imported into the organelle. Recently a series of human genetic disorders involving peroxisomal functions has been described. Some of these peroxisomal disorders are thought to be the consequence of a failure in the peroxisomal biogenetic mechanisms, in which the peroxisomal membrane plays an essential role. Unfor- tunately, the human peroxisomal membrane has been poorly studied: its protein composition is largely unknown, there are not antibodies available against its proteins, that can be used to study some aspects of peroxisomal biogenesis. This research will obtain a battery of polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies against the proteins of the human peroxisomal membrane, which can be used as reagents to evaluate the presence, abundance and subcellular localization of these peroxisomal proteins in fibroblasts derived from patients affected by disorders of peroxisomal biogenesis. The information obtained in this project will contribute to the knowledge of the structure, composition and function of human peroxisomes and to knowledge of the mechanism of peroxisome biogenesis. In addition, it will contribute to the under- standing of the role of peroxisome in genetic pathology.\n",

      "a9002020 DBI $152011 The PIs will develop and test a miniature open-cell CO2 and H20 (MICAH) sensor that can be inserted into the leaf chamber of a plant gas exchange system or used in eddy-covariance measurements of canopy photosynthesis and transpiration. The MICAH sensor will be developed at the Space Dynamics Laboratory by the technical personnel that recently delivered similar sensors to NASA for use in space suits. This design will provide low- maintenance, battery-powered sensors connected to open-sided absorption cells using infrared transmitting fiber optics. Innovative miniature components and microprocessor control will provide high-resolution performance in a hand-held, flexible instrument. This sensor is an important improvement in technology for plant gas exchange because it will allow accurate measurements of non- steady-state photosynthesis. Measurements of this type are necessary in the study of plant responses to sunflecks, and have been limited by the design of current instruments. Because the sensor will allow analysis of CO2 concentration in the leaf chamber directly, it will also allow the development of a true CO2 porometer, which will improve the speed, accuracy, and portability of field gas exchange systems. Following the successful development of this sensor, a cost- sharing arrangement with NSF to make copies of it available to scientists whose research is limited by current sensor technology will proposed.\n",

The light emission is mediated by the morphology of the structure. The objective is to provide direct confirmation that the dominant mode for the emission of light is the slow mode, which has large fields in the oxide layer. Junctions will be grown on gratings with periods between 70 and 100 nanometers in order to provide the momentum mismatch between the slow mode and the emitted light.\n",

Because a wide variety of information concerning the structure of molecules can be encoded in terms of constraints on their interatomic distances, our first goal is to improve our understanding of and ability to reason directly with these constraints. The next goal is to devise more efficient and reliable methods of finding atomic coordinates compatible with the constraints, and determining what motions are consistent with them. The final goal is to develop a user-friendly, window-oriented interface that enables one to visually prepare the input, perform the computations, and analyze their results graphically.\n",

A flash lamp is used for interrogation of absorption signals, resulting in extremely high optical resolution coupled with nanosecond time resolution. The use of fiber optic guides to direct light into and away from experimental samples allows the instrument to be easily reconfigured to measure fluorescence and luminescence, all of which make use of essentially the same sensitive electronic components. This type of instrument is used often for biophysical studies of photosynthetic material. Accordingly, four of the major and one of the minor users will concentrate on photosynthetic parameters to evaluate models of protein translocation across biological membranes, responses of photosynthetic material to changing light conditions, organization of the photosynthetic electron transport chain, and intracellular communication between chloroplasts and cell surfaces. Proposed uses for instrument not directly related to photosynthesis include determination of the viscosity of model membranes around reconstituted membrane proteins, investigation of the effects of mutations in the phytochrome apoprotein on phytochrome function, and development of sensitive assays for the function of electrogenic ATPases.\n",
      "a9002041 DBI $39100 A group of investigators with related interest in the synthesis, immunogenicity and conformation of middle-sized peptide fragments and small proteins propose to install a circular dichroism spectrometer (dichrograph) with controlling computer. No instrument for measuring circular dichroism spectra is currently available in the Wistar Institute or at the University of Pennsylvania. The dichrograph will permit a quick spectroscopic characterization of a large number of peptides synthesized for immunological studies, and as models for protein folding intermediates. It will provide information on the secondary structure and conformational flexibility in solution of the synthetic fragments. The instrument will make it possible to study the correlation conformational changes of immunogenic peptides as well as conformational changes due to post-translational modifications (e.g., glycosylation and phosphorylation).

Work will continue addressing possible extensions of this closed form expression. Initial efforts will be made to establish a formula for the ratios of alternantes to the Selberg symmetric functions. It is expected that they will be given explicitly in terms of tournaments. Work will also be done on beta type distributions and their orthogonal polynomials.

Dr. Sturmfels has proposed to make use of the combinatorial structure of convex polytopes to attack problems in constructive algebra and algebraic geometry. His research on combinatorial structures arising in geometry will include a study of higher-order matroids associated with graded ideals and how they relate to the state polytopes of these ideals. This research falls in the broad category of combinatorics, which is one of the most active fields in today's mathematics. Fundamentally, combinatorics represents a systematization of the very first of all mathematical activities, counting. In its modern development, however, combinatorics has gone beyond just counting to make use of a wide variety of advanced mathematical techniques, and although its roots go back several centuries, the field has had an explosive development in the past few decades because of its importance in communications and information technology.\n",
      "a9002058 MCB $335000 Studies of the genetic mechanisms controlling developmental commitments during embryogenesis are among the most active and significant in biomedical research. The powerful methodological approaches possible with Drosophila have shown that clusters of homeotic genes function to establish developmental fate. Recent exciting results indicate that mammals have genes with recognizable homology which are expressed in domains paralleling those of the insect homeotic genes. Although the further developmental and molecular characterization of these mammalian genes is a fascinating prospect, progress towards understanding their precise roles will ultimately be limited by the difficulty of isolating and studying mutations. The proposed project will focus on the homeotic genes of the red flour beetle (Tribolium castenum), an insect offering the possibility of integrated genetic, developmental and molecular studies with a resolution similar to that possible with Drosophila, but which is evolutionarily well diverged from flies and shows many interesting differences. Available balancers and deficiencies will allow the identification by saturation mutagenesis of the developmentally significant genes in the portion of the single homeotic complex of Tribolium corresponding to the Drosophila ANT-C, and their mutant syndromes will be described. Portions of several homeotic genes have already been molecularly cloned from a genomic library, and embryonic cDNA and genomic YAC libraries will also be screened. After these experiments have isolated the remaining genes and correlated them with the genetic map, further studies will determine their organization as well as spatial and temporal patterns of expression. Such an integrated approach will enable studies of the interactions of these homeotic genes with one another and with genes up and downstream in this developmental pathway. Even in a research area as active as the evolution and function of homeotic genes, the methodological advantages of Tribolium will generate unique insights into the regulation of developmental fate.\n",

First, the project will focus on the relationship between techniques like the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser theory, and the accelerated convergence methods developed to study localized states in Schrodinger operators with random or quasi-periodic potentials, and will attempt to exploit these relationships to prove the existence of periodic orbits in partial differential equations. Second, it will investigate how ideas like center manifold theorem can be combined with a Hamiltonian structure to study partial differential equations like the Boussinesq equation and other equations related to hydrodynamics. Finally, it will study the existence of quantities like the Liapunov exponents for infinite dimensional dynamical systems arising in statistical mechanics. A better understanding of such quantities would give one a dynamical analogue of the thermodynamic limit in equilibrium statistical mechanics.\n",

The main purpose of the study will be to analyze the deletions at the molecular level and to clone and sequence their breakpoint junctions. They will determine the size of the deletions, many of which are submicroscopic and study the mechanism by which these deletions occur. The study will elucidate basic mechanisms of mutagenesis that may be involved in all kinds of genetic processes: somatic or germinal mutations related to the origin of congenital or acquired disease, somatic or germinal spontaneous neutral mutations without pathologic consequences, or normal evolutionary processes. The strength of Drs. Slavutsky and Larripa's group, is the microscopic cytogenetic analysis of chromosome abnormalities in cancer cells and experimental mammalian cytogenetics. They will develop the methods of analysis of DNA rearrangements associated with the chromosome abnormalities detected in their studies. Their interaction with Dr Diaz`s laboratory will help them to develop this capability, and at the same time will allow both groups to coordinate their efforts in the study of the molecular basis of chromosome rearrangements in mammalian cells They have in their laboratory the necessary equipment to perform DNA extraction from mammalian cells and to perform Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA. This is in addition to all the tissue culture, optical and photographic equipment and facilities necessary for cytogenetic analysis. The strength of the University of Chicago laboratory is the analysis of DNA rearrangements generated by such chromosomal abnormalities, the identification and cloning of the DNA sequences located at the translocation breakpoints, and the identification and characterization of genes affected by these rearrangements. Because these two laboratories complement each other so well, the mutual benefits of this collaboration are evident.\n",

      "a9002068 INT $0 This award will provide supplementary support to enable Dr. Marc Lamphier of Harvard University to conduct collaborative research for 21 months with Dr. Tadatsugu Taniguchi of the Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Osaka University, Japan. They will study the genetic regulations of the beta-interferon response. Interferons are cytokines which induce the expression of a number of genes involved in the defense against viral and bacterial infections, inhibitions of tumor growth, modulation of the immune response, and possibly in the regulation of normal growth and development. The human beta-interferon gene was cloned by Dr. Taniguchi in 1979, and initially overexpressed in E. coli in a collaboration between Taniguchi and the lab at Harvard with which Lamphier is now affiliated. Two mammalian DNA-binding proteins (IRF-1 and IRF-2) which recognize a common regulatory element in the human beta-interferon promotor have recently been identified and cloned. The present effort will investigate the mechanism by which these two factors coordinate gene regulation, and use the factors to try to identify part of the network of genes which moderate the cellular response to beta-interferon.\n",
      "a9002069 DMS $42100 The study of 3-manifolds could be described to the lay person as the study of all possible 3-dimensional universes which are locally \"like\" the space we live in. This project will continue research into a class of 3-manifolds called laminated manifolds. It has the potential to influence the subject quite significantly, especially if two goals are achieved. The first goal is to extend methods and theorems from the well-known class of Haken manifolds to the larger class of laminated manifolds. The second goal is to show that, in some sense, \"most\" 3- manifolds are laminated. Another part of the project deals with surfaces or 2- manifolds. Here the object is to study certain geometric structures on surfaces, the spaces of these structures (Teichmueller spaces), laminations to which the geometric structures degenerate, and spaces of these laminations. The remainder of the project deals with codimension-1 laminations in manifolds of arbitrary dimension, especially with those having transverse structures.\n",
      "a9002072 DMS $150100 A central question in the foundations of mathematics is: Which set existence axioms are needed in order to prove specific theorems of ordinary mathematics? Here \"ordinary mathematics\" refers to the parts of mathematics which are not overtly set theoretical. For instance \"ordinary mathematics\" includes subjects such as geometry, differential equations, real and complex analysis, countable algebra, countable combinatorics, and the topology of complete separable metric spaces. On the other hand, \"ordinary mathematics\" does not include topics such as general topology and uncountable cardinal arithmetic. It has been found that the language of second order arithmetic is an appropriate context for the study of the above question. (This is because \"ordinary mathematics\" is to a large extent identifiable with countable and separable mathematics.) Moreover, a great many key theorems of ordinary mathematics, when formalized as sentences of second order arithmetic, turn out to be equivalent to the set existence axioms which are needed to prove them. (The equivalent is proved over a weak base theory.) Surprisingly, the number of inequivalent set existence axioms which arise in this way is rather small. This is the theme of Reverse Mathematics, which has been developed by Simpson and others and will be further developed under the current project.\n",
      "a9002076 BCS $7741 This dissertation research project in ecological anthropology will support a Spanish speaking cultural anthropologist for extended research on the knowledge about and use of Sabal palm trees in the Maya area of Yucatan, Mexico. These palms have been used domestically for at least 1000 years. Using archival, ecological, and ethnographic methods the investigator will analyze the systematic knowledge and current practices of the people using palm trees, and compare that to practices of previous populations. The study will compare information from three communities. The study will provide empirical evidence of interest to all research fields dealing with human-nature interactions. It will contribute to the growing body of knowledge of tropical forest environments, and could potentially be useful to development planners of settlements in similar environments.\n",

Ortiz-Conde of the Universidad Simon Bolivar in Caracas, Venezuela. The objective of the collaboration is the development of a circuit model for thin film silicon- on-insulator MOSFETs based upon the charge-sheet concept. The project will include checking the range of validity of the models, development of a computer aided design model, and calculation of static current-voltage characteristics. The technology involved in this project is of importance to radiation-tolerant integrated circuits, to novel three- dimensional integrated circuits, to high-voltage transistors, and to advanced device and circuits concepts all based on thin-film silicon-on-insulator MOSFETs. A considerable part of the analytical study will be carried out by the Venezuelan side, while experimental verification and determination of the range of validity will be done by the U.S. side.\n",

The instrumentation will be used in the research programs of several investigators, all of whom need to measure intracellular ion concentrations using various ion sensitive dyes. The specific projects in this proposal will investigate the role of intracellular calcium in cell volume recovery by invertebrate blood cells following a hypoosmotic stress; the role of calcium in acetylcholine receptor differentiation; the role of calcium in visual transduction in Limulus eye and vertebrate retina; the role of calcium fluctuations in the regulation of mitosis in plants.\n",
      "a9002087 IIS $192166 The proposed research is aimed at developing a systematic artificial neural network (ANN) design and training methodology and exploring its applications in robotics. The salient feature of the research is the use of statistical pattern recognition techniques to solve some key aspects of ANN and learning procedures. One major limitation of present ANNs operating under the supervised mode of learning is that these networks are unable to self-configure the architecture for a given classification problem. A solution to this problem is to establish a direct relationship between a class of nonparametric classifiers, i.e. decision trees, and the multilayer neural networks. It can be shown that a decision tree can be restructured as a three layered neural net. Exploiting this restructuring allows neural network design and training methodology to have self-configuration capability. The tree-to-network mapping also provides a solution to the credit assignment problem thus making it possible to train each layer separately and progressively. The research will explore automatic tree generation, incorporation of incremental learning, and adaptability in such networks. The proposed methodology will be applied to robot learning where networks are required to perform regression rather than classification. The main expected benefit of the proposed research is that it will make available an ANN design and training procedure that is systematic. This should result in many more applications for artificial neural networks.\n",
      "a9002089 DBI $212434 Software will be developed that provides experimental control of stimulus display and data acquisition in neurophysiological and psychophysical investigations of visual processing. This software is being developed for three main reasons: (1) to take advantage of advances in computer technology that facilitate the development of such systems, (2) to incorporate an extensive library of low- level visual display drivers that have been developed at NYU over the past five years, and (3) to incorporate modern design concepts into the software. The software is expected to provide the basic experimental control program for the next 5-10 years for the research group involved in this proposal. In addition, a key design feature of the software system is portability, with the goal of freeing its general structure from dependance on a specific processor architecture or on a particular set of input and output devices. The common theme of the research that will initially use the newly developed software is that it relies upon computer controlled generation and display of visual patterns, either on monochrome or color monitors along with the collection of stimulus-evoked behavioral and neural responses. Although the initial effort will concentrate on the generation of software for visual experimentation, the design of the system is by no means limited to this area, and adaptation of the general control structures to a wide range of neural and behavioral experiments should be straightforward.\n",
      "a9002091 DMI $249930 This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in the general area of materials chemistry and in the subfield metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). The goal of this activity is the development of volatile MOCVD reagents for use in the fabrication of tellurium alloy thin films. Mercury cadmium telluride (MCT) has important potential applications as a material for passive infrared detectors. MOCVD of MCT necessitates development of new tellurium element source reagents with increased volatility and lower growth temperatures. During the tenure of Phase I research under NSF grant ISI-8860518, a new class of compounds, trifluoromethyl(alkyl)tellurides, was synthesized via a novel ligand exchange reaction. These compounds were shown to have a significantly higher volatility and comparable decomposition temperatures to the best reagents currently available. In this Phase II study, large scale syntheses of these compounds will be developed and they will be used as Te source reagents for the growth of CdTe films. The physical and electrical properties of the films will be determined. Simultaneously, further work will be done to elucidate the pyrolysis mechanisms of the trifluoromethyl(alkyl)tellurides and the mechanism of the ligand exchange reaction. This information, combined with the film growth studies, should allow determination of the optimum source reagent and the development of a large scale, high purity synthesis of that compound.\n",
      "a9002095 DMS $19650 This award supports the research in arithmetic algebraic geometry of Professor William McCallum of the University of Arizona. Dr. McCallum's project is to study the Shafarevich-Tate group of elliptic curves and Abelian varieties defined over number fields in order to verify a number of conjectures of Kolyvagin. The elliptic curves under consideration will be modular, while the Abelian varieties to be studied will all be Jacobian varieties of Fermat curves. Arithmetic algebraic geometry is a subject that combines the techniques of algebraic geometry and number theory. In its original formulation, algebraic geometry treated figures that could be defined in the plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Number theory started with the whole numbers and such questions as divisibility of one whole number by another. These two subjects, seemingly so far apart, have in fact influenced each other from the earliest times, but in the past quarter century the mutual influence has increased greatly. The field of arithmetic algebraic geometry now uses techniques from all of modern mathematics, and is having corresponding influence beyond its own borders.\n",
      "a9002102 INT $7360 This award will support Professor C. Denise Caldwell of the University of Central Florida in a research collaboration with Professor J. Jimenez-Mier of the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM). The investigators intend to measure the alignment of photoions as determined through the angular distribution of decay fluorescence. The experiments will be performed at the University of Wisconsin Synchrotron Radiation Center with an apparatus that has been specifically constructed for performing this type of experiment. The experimental effort will be joined by the investigator from Mexico, who will be responsible for all data analysis and analytic interpretation. Measurement of alignment of photoions by fluorescence analysis is a relative newcomer to the group of techniques that are available for study of electron-electron correlation. Due to its sensitivity to effects of this interaction, it has the potential of becoming a powerful tool, especially for analysis at thresholds. In addition to the application of this technique to the study of various systems, the investigators will try to interpret its measurements in terms of existing theories.\n",

      "a9002110 IBN $54000 In all mammalian species, reproductive success is critically dependant upon normal function of the ovary. Normal ovarian function serves two purposes, production of the oocyte, and appropriate production and secretion of specific steroid and protein hormones. In the mammalian ovary, the oocyte is encased in several layers of cells which secrete the female sex steroid hormone estrogen. At ovualation, the oocyte is extruded from the ovary and the cells which previously surrounded the oocyte are changed into a structure called the corpus luteum. The cells of the corpus luteum, the luteal cells, secrete the female sex steroid hormone, progesterone. The secretion of progesterone from the corpus luteum in the proper amounts for the proper time period is required for successful reproduction. Thus, progesterone secretion from the corpus luteum is a critical determinant of reproductive success. The cells of the corpus luteum must respond, through biochemical mechanisms, to blood born hormonal substances which control the normal secretion of progesterone. The specific biochemical mechanisms which allow the luteal to respond to those hormones which control progesterone secretion are at present unknown. It is, in fact, these mechanisms that are responsible for normal luteal function. Dr. Goldsmith has recently discovered that, in the rat, the expression of a particular gene, the K-ras gene, increases greatly at the same time that the seretion of progesterone from the corpus luteum is at its maximum. Furthermore, when an antibody against the protein coded for by this gene was incorporated into luteal cells in vitro, progesterone secretion from these cells was significantly decreased, thus demonstrating that the protein encoded by the K-ras gene, the p21 protein, plays a role in the production/secretion of progesterone by the luteal cell. It is the objective of this proposal to determine the specific way in which the p21 protein affects luteal progesterone secretion and whether the p21 protein plays a role in the secretion of other hormones from the corpus luteum. The K-ras gene product, the p21 protein, is present in all mammalian cells. Thus, the results of the proposed studies will have a significant impact upon the understanding of ovarian hormone secretory mechanisms as well as our understanding of the ways in which all mammalian cells respond to hormones and growth factors.\n",
      "a9002112 BCS $9574 The primate Family Cheirogaleidae is classified within the suborder Strepsirhini which includes both lemuriform primates from Madagascar and lorisiform primates from Africa and Asia. The exact placement of the Cheirogaleidae, which are found only in Madagascar, has been a problem for some time. Traditionally they have been placed with the other Madagascar primates, largely on a biogeographic basis. Most recent classifications, however, place them with the African/Asian lorisiform primates, largely on the basis of features in the base of the skull. This proposal addresses the question: are the cheirogaleid primates more closely related to the lemuriform or to the lorisiform primates? A number of data sets, including anatomical, embryological, and genetic information will examined to determine their relationships. The clarification of cheirogaleid affinities will be significant for at least three reasons. A classification is necessary that is commensurate with phylogenetic relationships. An understanding of the sister-group relationships between cheirogaleids and other strepsirhines is necessary to determine the effects of homology versus convergence. And, if cheirogaleids and lorisiforms are more closely related it will confirm that multiple migrations between Madagascar and Africa must have occurred during the history of the primates.\n",

Dr. Millson has proposed to work in two main areas: first, he will apply the methods of rational homotopy theory to deformation problems in algebraic geometry; and second, he will continue his research on the cohomology of discrete subgroups of orthogonal and unitary groups. This is research in the field of algebraic geometry, one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had a revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. In its origin, it treated figures that could be defined in the plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials.

      "a9002118 IBN $264828 Body growth depends on a hormonal stimulus for growth and adequate quality and quantity of nutrients. When nutrients are limiting, growth is stunted. Upon removal of nutritional restraint, catch-up growth occurs. This project attempts to elucidate how nutrition contols growth in an animal model in which spontaneous running stimulates growth of lean body mass and skeleton. To assess how exercise affects hormones of growth, and in conjunction with nutrients, stimulates growth, measurements will be taken of gene activation for synthesis of hormones of growth and of tissue proteins. This study will contribute to the understanding of the mechanism of growth and of the nature of the stimulatory effects of exercise and food energy on growth. The results may provide insights for treatment of children or juvenile animals in whom dietary restriction produces the stunting of growth.\n",

For the most part, this award will support the \"Advanced Research Component,\" which over the course of the project will convene the foremost dynamical systems theorists in the world, college research faculty, and graduate students. Research activities in complex analytic dynamics, computational complexity, attractors, renormalization, annular maps, neural networks, and fractal geometry will be organized by several experts. Activities are also planned between summers. Coupled to this award will be a four-year project funded through the Division for Teacher Preparation and Enhancement (TPE-8954797). Entitled, \"Contemporary Mathematics and Technology as a Driving Force for School Reform,\" this project will draw pre-college teachers from two Boston area school districts to the same environment to learn dynamics and methods by which these topics can be infused into the high school curriculum. Also coupled to these projects in the first year is a Young Scholars Project (RCD-8855151) entitled Project PROMYS- Program in Mathematics for Young Scientists. This ongoing project draws bright high school students together to study a variety of research problems in dynamical systems which have been tailored to their level of mathematics expertise. Participants from each of the three funded projects will have extensive opportunities to work together and learn from one another. Mixed groups will be formed for day-to-day discussions and field trips. These will study dynamics problems from several viewpoints. A well-equipped \"Dynamics Lab\" will be made available to all participants and is seen as a focal point for interaction activities.\n",

      "a9002132 CCR $100000 Initial experiments with a graph reduction model for nondeterministic program control indicate that this is a viable and natural approach. Appropriate reduction rules for and and or combinators together with a new type of tagged node (alt nodes) enable the straightforward compilation of declarative language statements to graph sections whose reduction by simple rewrite rules will effect backtracking. Other graph reduction approaches to logic languages place this burden on the metalanguage. The matching of an operational graph reduction model with a denotational semantics for the declarative language B provides an elegant framework for extension to full logic programming and the future incorporation of more advanced control structures. Although the current model abstracts the complexities of state by making explicit a state argument, there are appropriate alternative strategies that can be employed in the extension. Other investigators are currently producing graph reduction models incorporating appropriate behavior for logic variables, which will be considered in our extension. The main objective is to develop the current model to correctly and efficiently model sophisticated control for declarative languages. Investigation of methods to superimpose Prolog's cut is already underway. The model will seek ways to incorporate the necessary control information into the graph. The success of simple alt nodes in modeling nondeterminism is an encouraging start.\n",
      "a9002133 DMS $68400 Professor Casian will attempt to extend his recent proof of the Kazhdan-Lusztig conjecture for Kac-Moody algebras in the symmetrizable case in various directions. One direction will involve Schubert varieties of finite dimension instead of those of finite codimension or infinite dimension. Another will entail trying to remove the symmetrizability assumption. In addition Professor Casian's research will focus on weight filtrations on Harish-Chandra modules. This research involves the theory of group representations. Group theory is basically the theory of symmetry. To take a simple example, when the system in question is invariant under a change in the position of the origin of space, the group of translations naturally arises. While groups are abstract objects, particular situations demand concrete realizations or \"representations\" of the symmetry group.\n",
      "a9002135 IIS $99007 This research will develop a flexible knowledge representation medium and sufficient natural language processing tools to allow the automated extension of an expert system's knowledge base through access to machine-readable natural language texts such as dictionaries, thesauri, and technical references. The work on an early prototype has used the Merck manual as a source ?Merck 1977!. Initial work will include the building of a parsing system consisting of a core grammar and the means to expand the core grammar semi-automatically. Using this parsing system, the effort will develop the incremental augmentation of the knowledge system directly from the analysis of the text. The ability of an expert system to extend its own knowledge base by extracting information from machine readable text is valuable for a wide variety of systems, including expert systems for large technical applications in a domain in which the information is continually being updated. Other projects rely on human intervention during the process that extracts new knowledge ?Lenat et al. 1986; Humphrey 1989; Antonacci et al. 1989!. This makes dealing with problems such as contradictory information much easier. In contrast, here the feasibility of automating the actual extraction of information, in a disciplined way, from a structured technical reference will be examined.\n",

The wide range of isotopic masses for iron (54 to 58), together with its involvement in microbially-mediated reactions, other redox reactions, diffusion, transport and precipitation, strongly suggest that isotopic effects are likely, and that their interpretation will lead to a better understanding of natural processes that are important both in research and in environmental assessment.\n",

      "a9002151 IBN $20636 Invertebrate nervous systems are structurally less elaborate than those of vertebrates. This simplicity along with the accessibility of their nervous system have permitted detailed electrophysiological and morphological studies resulting in the construction of functional circuit diagrams. Dr. Stretton has used Ascaris summ, a large nematode parasite of pigs, as a model system to understand the neural circuits controlling locomotion. Their relatively simple movements are coordinated by a motor nervous system that contains approximately 77 neurons distributed within the ventral nerve cord along the length of the worm. He has found that along with the classic neurotransmitters that operate within the nematode nervous system are a large number of immunoreactive neuropeptide-like substances. These data indicate that previously unknown elaborate communication system exists in these simple organisms similar to that reported in more complex animals. Dr. Stretton along with Dr. Wright, his postdoctoral fellow, will isolate, clone, and sequence the gene that encodes two bioactive neuropeptides. Since each neuropeptide is a potentially potent chemical messenger with unique target- responses, they will characterize which motor nervous system neurons are likely to express individual peptides. The results obtained using this simple system will enhance our understanding of the neurochemical basis of locomotion and its coordination. Moreover, studies on the basic neurobiology of nematodes may provide a rational basis for the design of controls on these parasites found in man, domesticated animals and cultivated plants.\n",
      "a9002152 DMS $42927 One central theme of this project focuses on nonlinear partial differential equations representing the evolution of certain physical phenomena. An evolution equation whose solutions are smoother than the initial data is said to have a gain of regularity. An example of this occurs in the Schrodinger equation if the initial data decay faster than any polynomial. Some success has also been obtained in the nonlinear area, particularly in the case of the Korteweg-de Vries equation. In this work, a general class of equations will be investigated for gain in regularity. It will concentrate on equations in three space dimensions and seek to prove that gain in regularity is governed by the sign of the third derivative of the solution. Method of proof uses the technique of nonlinear multipliers and a fundamental energy (integral) estimate which shows the gain. Efforts will also be made in applying similar ideas to dispersive equations such as nonlinear Schrodinger equations. A second line of investigation concerns spectral and inverse spectral problems of the Laplace operator or the Laplace operator plus a potential defined on compact Riemannian manifolds. Three objectives of this work are to: (1) describe the distribution of the eigenvalues, (2) identify the properties of a Riemannian metric or a potential which are spectral invariants, and (3) determine the metrics or potentials which can be isospectrally deformed in a mathematically significant manner. Particular emphasis will be placed on measuring the pattern of gaps between eigenvalues and the density properties of potentials with a finite number of double eigenvalues.\n",

Dr. Kriz has proposed to study major questions of well-partial- ordering theory in connection with Ramsey theory. Specifically, he will attempt to generalize the Robertson-Seymour graph-minor theorem to the case of infinite graphs, and will continue his investigations of ordinal invariants in well-partial-ordering theory and Ramsey theory. This research falls in the broad category of combinatorics, which is one of the most active fields in today's mathematics. Fundamentally, combinatorics represents a systematization of the very first of all mathematical activities, counting. In its modern development, however, combinatorics has gone beyond just counting to make use of a wide variety of advanced mathematical techniques, and although its roots go back several centuries, the field has had an explosive development in the past few decades because of its importance in communications and information technology.\n",

The principal investigator will work on the canonical element conjecture of Hochster and related problems.

This is currently a very active area in which an associated commutative algebra is used to obtain refined knowlege about the underlying geometric object.\n",
      "a9002162 DMI $249668 The object of this research project is to show the feasibility of an advanced concept, video imaging microscope whose features include real-time, three- color video images, instantaneous zoom, very low illumination power, selective contrast enhancement, and highly linear densitometry. Data resolution matched the diffraction limit of the optics over a wide range of magnification. Low cost, direct viewing models would be useful for routine clinical applications and multi-user observation of cell smears or sections in pathology, hematopathlogy, and cytology. Such a system could be the ideal vehicle for the creation of video teaching databases of pathological abnormalities, and provide the critical link between optical microscopy and the rapidly expanding area of video image display, storage, processing, and teleconferencing. Expanded feature models with automated stages, automatic focusing, and computerized image processing facilities would be useful for the development of automated cell analysis in pathology, hematology , cytology, and many other disciplines.\n",

The work under Phase I resulted in demonstration of the feasibility of an innovative concept using microbes to biologically degrade volatile halogenated aliphatic organic contaminants of soil. The process achieved as much as 99.9 percent destruction of trichloroethylene. In Phase II, the scope of the work will be narrowed to a liquid-phase reactor that is of sufficiently large scale to facilitate full- scale design and construction of prototype bioreactors and determine the commercial applicability of the process by determining its efficiency and economic feasibility. The contamination of ground and surface waters by organic compounds that are the target of this research is a matter of great National concern. It is imperative that technologies be developed that are more efficiently responsive to decontamination of soil.1 Results of this project are expected to be useful in this respect.\n",

The work under Phase I resulted in demonstration of the feasibility of using electrochemically generated superoxide for rapid and complete degradation of chlorinated organic pollutants of water using specially designed electrodes that allowed for the efficient dechlorination of the pollutant substrates. In Phase II, the investigators plan a systematic examination of the reaction products and their rate of formation and destruction as the basis for determining the efficiency of the process and its economic feasibility.

      "a9002168 OCE $160000 The overall goal of this research is to determine quantitatively, the interactive regulatory factors and underlying mechanisms of predator-prey dynamics in a marine soft-bottom community. The researchers have extensive background knowledge as well as an innovative ultrasonic biotelemetry techniques to examine the predator-prey complex in a small sub-estuary (the Rhode River) of Chesapeake Bay. The researchers will measure the components of predator behavior which lead to changes in the functional and aggregative responses. The predator-prey complex includes large blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) which feed on two common species of infaunal clams (Macoma balthica and Mya arenaria) as well as cannibalizing small blue crabs. Demersal fish are also abundant predators which feed extensively on clam siphons and other benthic invertebrates which live in the sediments, but not on large whole clams. Earlier work focused on the interactive effects of prey species, sediment type, and prey density on the persistence of prey encountering intense predation, with emphasis on the functional response of blue crabs foraging on clams. Biotelemetry has been used to determine the scales of variation in predator behavior and movement between key prey patches. Thus, these investigatins focus on the blue crab's aggregative response with prey patches, which links the regulatory factors, underlying mechanisms, and resulting dynamics of this predator-prey system. This research will: 1) determine the interactive factors (prey species, prey density, and predator density) regulating the aggregative response of the main predator (large blue crabs); 2) determine the interactive factors (density and distribution of prey, habitat refugia, and predator density) regulating predation rates upon two alternate prey (clams and small crabs); and 3) investigate the behavioral/physiological mechanisms of large blue crabs aggregating in prey patches and switching between small crabs and clams.\n",
      "a9002172 INT $5550 This award will provide supplemental support to enable Dr. Robin Staffin of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to conduct collaborative research for 12 months with Dr. Toshihisa Tomie of the Electrotechnical Laboratory in Tsukuba, Japan. They will investigate the physics of plasma x-ray lasers, with a goal of scaling to shorter wavelengths to enable holographic imaging of live biological specimens. Since the demonstration five years ago of a laboratory x-ray laser, there has been a world-wide pursuit to extend lasing to higher powers, shorter wavelengths, and smaller divergence. This research will investigate the physics of plasma x-ray lasers via physical and numerical modeling, calculations of laser gain, trapping and propagation, and analysis of the conditions and requirements for x-ray laser coherence. The Krf excimer laser at the Electrotechnical Laboratory is well suited to these studies, and is complemented by the availability of Cray and Fujitsu supercomputers, which are necessary for the modeling studies. The collaboration between Dr. Tomie, an experimentalist, and Dr. Staffin, a theoretical modeler, should prove synergistic.\n",

In the former he has shown that the protonolysis rate is accelerated by bis- thiol ligation of the substrate mercury, and the generality of this reaction will now be explored. For the reductase, the one-electron and two-electron reduction potentials for various liganded mercuric ions will be determined in order to resolve the thermodynamics of the system. Studies will be initiated in the area of RNA self-splicing and self cleavage. The plausible role of metal ions as transition state stabilizers in the general base catalyzed displacement reactions of ribose 2' and 3' hydroxyl groups on phosphodiester linkages will be probed by the synthesis of suitable dinucleotide models. The relationships of structure to hammerhead self cleavage will be determined by molecular dynamics and energy minimization methods. A collaboration will be initiated with Drs. Lerner and Benkovic to produce porphyrin containing monoclonal antibodies to mimic heme dependent redox enzymes of another new direction.\n",

Cloning and high-level expression will aid in purifying wild-type and mutant forms of threonine deaminase for their biochemical characterization. Analysis of the protein concentration dependence of enzyme kinetic parameters will elucidate a model for the transition between low and high activity conformations. Identifying malfunctioning variants by classical genetics will reveal structural domains involved in catalysis and regulation, and their effect on the folding of polypeptides will be evaluated by x-ray crystallography. Sedimentation equilibrium studies of the tetramer-dimer interconversion of threonine deaminase will permit quantitative determination of changes in subunit interaction energy. Direct ligand binding measurements by equilibrium dialysis, coupled with the energetics of dimer- tetramer assembly, will reveal the thermodynamic basis for cooperativity. The cofactor pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, a chromophore in the active site, can reveal local changes promoted by effector binding that alter catalysis. Quantitative analysis of absorption spectra in terms of sums of lognormal curves will establish a free energy profile for the enzyme to assess the effect of heterotropic ligands on each step of the reaction pathway.

How to get at the data becomes a central problem for very large databases. This research addresses this problem through data visualization and visual reasoning. The main idea is to transform the data objects and present sample data in a visual space. The user can then incrementally formulate the information retrieval request in the visual space. By combining data visualization, visual query, visual examples, and visual cues, this research will yield better ways of formulating and modifying users' queries. A prototype system has been developed to serve as an experimental testbed.

      "a9002206 PHY $283054 The proposal has two main components. The first attempts to describe nucleon structure, and the interactions between nucleons in terms of Quantum Chromo dynamics, (QCD). There are two regions with a straight forward connection: short distances, where asymptotic freedom allows a perturbative treatment in terms of quarks and gluons, and large distances, where nucleons appear as manifestations of the non-linear nature of QCD at large distances: the latter leads to a picture of nucleons as solutionis, and can be handled in the large N (number of colors) and classical limit, while interactions between them can be described in terms of multi meson exchange. (\"QCD at small q is a complicated non-linear theory of mesons \"Witten). The aim is to understand the connection between these two pictures. As a start 1/N and quantum corrections to the solutionis picture are to be tackled. The second component is to continue the study of scattering theory with techniques that combine algebraic and analytic techniques: this has applications to molecular as well as nuclear physics.\n",

Specific aims for the two-year period of this collaborative component center around optimizing experimental design factors to attain significantly faster dehalogenation rates. The broad, long-term goals of the research project are to make possible new strategies for permanently effective detoxification of contaminated materials such as sediments, soils, and industrial oils, and to provide new insights into toxic and environmental interactions of organohalides by establishing fundamental kinetic and thermodynamic characteristics of their electron-transfer reactions. Environmental contamination with organohalide chemicals is a worldwide problem. Dehalogenation methods being developed should be directly applicable to other pollutants as well.

      "a9002225 ACI $128094 The goal of this project is to exploit a novel idea for obtaining speedup on vector and concurrent multiprocessors. Most, if not all, studies in parallelism focus on maximizing parallelism within a program or algorithm. It is well known that many programs/algorithms do not exhibit good characteristics of parallelism (e.g. Monte Carlo and general simulations, numerical computations that proceed iteratively, already existing poorly vectorized code, payroll programs, optimization algorithms, etc.) Clearly, one cannot squeeze any more parallelism from within a program if the program does not yield itself to this, and one cannot take already existing code and vectorize it if the code does not vectorize well (unless much time and money is spent in redesigning and rewriting code). Consider, for example, expensive oil-exploration simulations that run for several hours on a single data set. Simulation programs, being event based in nature, simply do not exhibit good characteristics of parallelism. Suppose that one has a program that does not vectorize well (such as the examples given above). Since it is very often the case that the same program has to be executed several times, each time on different data, why not create a Unified version of the program that executes on all the data, so that a single run of the unified program will achieve what a number of serial runs on different data achieves? The advantage is that on vector concurrent multiprocessors, such unified programs (1) yield speedup even though the original program does not, and (2) increase machine utilization more efficiently by exploiting the vector functional units heavily. A simple tool is made to transform the original program into an N-component vector version. Since the different data sets have different effects on program behavior, issues such as path divergence of programs affect speedup. Encouraging results from pilot studies suggest that path divergence can be dealt with through the use of a smart scheduler. The final tool will consist of a transform algorithm, a scheduler, and a decision support system that informs a user how to use the tool for a given program. The support system will use the program graph and machine characteristics to make its decisions.\n",
      "a9002228 CCR $102000 A general-purpose tool for computing and visualizing solutions to systems of algebraic equations shall be built. Diverse algorithms exist for this problem and related sub-problems. The goal of this project is also to develop a new set of solution techniques based on multi-polynomial resultants. Our designed tool shall be portable and allow rapid prototyping of new and existing algorithms, in an intelligent blend of algebraic and numeric methods and real solutions. Complex solutions can also be computed, but visualizing them is difficult. The software shall also take advantage of any parallel hardware that is present. In all, a substantial improvement is anticipated in the state of the art of algebraic equation solving. Overall, the approach is to devise novel algorithmic techniques, blend with existing methods as well as compare the relative efficacy of the various methods. A prototype system implementing some of these goals is built and evolving. It is written in Common Lisp and C, and runs under the version 11 of the X window system. The system is portable to any machine that runs vanilla Common Lisp, supports the X window system, and has at least a rudimentary Lisp/C interface. At the present time it can solve systems of up to two equations in any number of variables. Example applications of this are curve and surface display, curve-curve intersections, or surface surface intersections. A graphical user interface allows the display and manipulation of OD (points), 1D (curves) or 2D (surface) solutions. //\n",

      "a9002235 BCS $249795 The NSF will provide the first of an expected five years of support to the University of Arizona Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research. It allows the laboratory to hire a full-time dendrochronologist to analyze archaeological samples and provides half-time support for a graduate student assistant. The technique of tree-ring dating was pioneered at Arizona. Because the rate of tree growth is determined by environmental conditions, yearly growth rings in a tree vary in form and thickness. It is possible to build up a tree ring chronology by cross matching trees from the present to well back in the prehistoric past and then to use this \"master record\" to date small wood samples collected from archaeological and other situations. For archaeologists in the Southwestern United States, this technique has been a boon because it allows materials to be dated within one year. This far exceeds the accuracy of radiocarbon dating. Because it has not been adequately supported and because many archaeologists lack the funds to pay for its services, the Arizona laboratory has not been able on its own to keep pace with archaeological requests for sample dating. This project will help to remedy that situation. In particular, it will benefit young scientists and those not associated with main line research institutions.\n",

The results are expected to deepen our understanding of the factors which govern the rates and specificity of transfer of electrons within and between molecules. Experimental and theoretical methods which have been developed for studying the effects of electric fields in photosynthetic systems will be extended to non-biological systems. These approaches will be used to measure (1) the degree of charge separation in metal-to-ligand charge transfer and intervalence transitions in transition metal complexes, (2) the effects of applied electric fields on the electronic coupling between the donor and acceptor, (3) the degree of charge-transfer character in the excited states of donor-acceptor compounds which undergo electron transfer but whose absorption spectra are unaffected by the presence of the acceptor, (4) the effects of electric fields on the rates of electron transfer reactions or competing luminescence, and (5) the magnitude of the internal field correction for various polymeric matrices.\n",
      "a9002249 DMS $43099 The principal investigator will study several problems in optimal deterministic or stochastic control and probability, using the theory of nonlinear partial differential equations. The project consists of three parts. The optimal control of a singularly controlled Brownian motion will be studied using the results for free boundary problems. This approach has yielded regularity results when the dimension is equal to two and it is the first multi-dimensional result which yields the construction of the optimal process. It now appears that it can be generalized to higher dimensions. The second part of this project is devoted to the perturbation theory of infinite dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi equations. As a case study, the principal investigator will study an asymptotic problem related to simple exclusion processes. Finally, an application of the finite dimensional perturbation theory to a problem of production planning is described. The model to be studied has failure-prone machines, and the goal is to construct approximate optimal policies by exploiting the hierarchical structure of the model.\n",

The second major theme of the research is the study of the correlations in two electron atomic systems such as the negative alkali ions. These are easily accessible with tunable dye lasers and the experiments will be carried out using laser photodetachment in an ion beam and an ion trap. The work will lead to an enhanced understanding of the interaction of strong, oscillating fields with atoms and of electron correlation effects.\n",
      "a9002251 CCR $43665 Algebras and monads, domains and categories provide powerful approaches to various connected problems in computation and semantics. The project employs categories in formalizing the iterative process in fixed point constructions suitable for wide computational interpretation. Questions such as producing a systematic approach to interpreting non-termination and measuring the extent recursion coexists in the presence of powerful closure properties, necessary for semantic interpretation, will be answered. Recent progress in interpreting domains in non-standard models of computation will continue. The objective here is the enumeration of a powerful computation paradigm capable of broad semantic utilization in which notions such as order, continuity and effectiveness are intrinsically defined. An important goal is providing a logical framework that will systematize present work, promote greater accessibility, and point to possible future implementation. The research will utilize algebras and monads to study partial data types and their computations. Utilizing recent success with Kleisli and Eilenberg-Moore algebras, a systematic study of various monadic refinements and their corresponding computation calculi will be undertaken.

Issues addressed by this study would include (1) the role of selection in chromosome evolution, (2) the relationship between evolutionary divergence and chromosome pairing, (3) the extent of evolutionary parallelism in complex anatomical features, (4) the possible origin from within Calycadenia of two highly-distinctive monotypic genera (Osmadenia and Blepharipappus) and their accompanying suites of unique phenotypic characters, and (5) the taxinomic validity of a proposed-endangered species, C.fremontii. This study would be among the first to integrate extensive phylogenetically-informative data from cytogenetics, phytochemistry, and morphology with evolutionary data from diverse nucleotide sequences in both chloroplast and nuclear DNA. Preliminary chloroplast DNA restriction site data revealed an ideal level of interspecific variation for conducting molecular phylogenetic analysis in this group. //\n",

      "a9002273 CMS $7500 This research program is part of the initiative to collect perishable data resulting from the 17 October 1989 Northern California (Loma Prieta) earthquake. The objective is to obtain data on soil failures in the Marina District of San Francisco: this perishable data will be analyzed at a later date with the objective of developing a simple and efficient technique to assess the stability and displacement of liquefied soils. The observations are designed to provide data on ground failures which can lead to answers to the following questions: 1. Are sand boils related to the damage caused by liquefaction? 2. Do the sand boils in the Marina District form a pattern or are they randomly distributed? 3. Is there a relation between the superficial ground displacement, soil profile and the size of the sand boils, their relative spatial frequency and distribution? 4. Is it possible to reconstruct the failure mechanisms within soil layers by examining the sand boils?\n",
      "a9002276 CMS $155480 An important factor in estimating a tsunami hazard from a particular source is knowledge of what previous tsunamis from that general region have done. The record of these effects is far from complete for the U.S. West Coast. Given a return rate of 100 to 200 years for many great Pacific earthquakes, and the changes in the population density, coastal development, and coastal area usage since the 19th Century, the hazard from a repeat of these events is significantly increased. Of the 13 tsunamis with amplitudes of 1 meter or more which occurred on the West Coast, only the latest two, 1960 and 1964, caused damage of more than a few thousand dollars. These waves would not have been particularly noteworthy had they occurred in the 19th Century or early 20th Century; reports of their effects would be limited to local sources. Conversely, tsunamis which did occur in the 18th Century without causing significant damage could be destructive if they are repeated in the future. Automatic recording tide gages were installed at San Diego and San Francisco, California, and Astoria, Oregon in 1854, the earliest operated in the Pacific. The publication of newspapers on the West Coast began at a somewhat earlier date. Using contemporary records, extant tide gage records, and a tide prediction computer program, this project will improve the quality of the historical record by adding new descriptive and quantitative data, correcting errors in existing knowledge, and reducing the uncertainty of the source and effects of reports of early tsunamis. Analyses of the resulting improved data base will show the unique features of the hazard. This information is essential to the design of effective tsunami warning systems and other counter measures.\n",

Phase transitions and intermolecular or interionic vibrational motions will be studied in liquids at various temperatures and pressures to elucidate the nature of liquid state molecular motion, the extent of inhomogeneity in simple liquids, and the persistence of local liquid structure.\n",
      "a9002286 DMS $115000 This is a proposal to study shock wave and other discontinuous solutions of the equations that govern the flow of compressible fluids. For example, there are still many unanswered questions regarding the role that dissipative mechanisms play in the interaction of two or more shock waves and the long-time stability of such waves. The principal investigators will use analytic and asymptotic tools to answer these questions and related ones. In addition to the usual equations of fluid dynamics the principal investigators will study systems of equations in magneto-hydrodynamics, the kinetic theory of gases, and the theory of shallow water waves. Dissipative forces like friction can be small in certain problems in fluid dynamics, but their effect cannot be neglected. For example, the viscosity (internal friction) of a gas is very small and yet it affects the large-scale behavior of objects that move through the gas. The principal investigators will study how such small dissipative mechanisms can influence the formation and propagation of shock waves in gases. A shock wave is something like a sonic boom, and it is an important feature of flows at high speeds.\n",

The scientific areas of the cooperative research are the interaction of high frequency electromagnetic and light waves in semiconductor devices and fiberoptic sensors. Drexel has an active program studying the interaction of lightwaves and high-frequency electromagnetic waves in semi- conducting materials and devices. These studies include the nonlinear behavior of semi-conductor lasers with external cavities and the performance of monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) components under optical illumination. In addition CMLE has an active program in fiberoptic sensor devices. In Brazil, CETUC has well established programs in the same technical areas. At CETUC, research is progressing on sensors for the Brazilian power industry. The proposed cooperative work will adapt the methods developed at CMLE for voltage and current sensing, which is of interest to CETUC, and expand on the basic understanding of modal coupling in fibers. Both experimental and analytic research are planned. Previous contacts between the researchers at CETUC and CMLE have included exchange of scientific information and sample devices, exchange of graduate students, visits and lectures at each institution and collaboration on scientific articles and books. This work represents the culmination of a previous informal cooperation. The proposed research will be a natural extension of present activities and will emphasize the overlapping interests of these two collaborating partners in the fundamental, generic aspect of the research topics identified above.\n",
      "a9002292 CCR $199782 The reseach concerns the computational complexity of feasible computations. The objectives of this project are twofold: to establish a firm complexity theoretic underpinning for public-key cryptography; to reveal the rich structure that individual complexity classes, such as NP, appear to have, and to increase understanding of the structural relations between low-level complexity classes. One emphasis will be to continue research in structural complexity theory that lays a foundation for cryptography. The approach is to base the investigation of existence of cryptographic assumptions (or primitives) directly on structural properties of complexity classes, rather than on presumed intractability of individual concrete problems.\n",

Foda of the Department of Civil Engineering, University of California, Berkeley, to the laboratories of Professor Tetsuo Sakai, Department of Civil Engineering, Kyoto University, and Professor Yoshi-Hiko Maeno, Department of Civil Engineering, Maizaru College of Technology, Japan. The research will focus on coastal engineering and porous media dynamics, in particular the generation mechanisms of multiphase wave in fluid-filled porous media. Experiments will be conducted on two of the most promising mechanisms of generation, one being relevant to earthquake shaking of soil masses; and the other to the phenomena of seabed lique- faction by ocean waves. The results are expected to increase our understanding of the interaction of seabed, ocean waves and earthquakes.\n",

This will be accomplished using both laboratory experiments and various theoretical calculations. The former will exploit an existing acoustic device (at MIT) designed to suspend selected crystals using standing sound waves. This device will be used to determine the collision efficiency between ice particles and water-ice particles. Also, electric charge separation will be measured when charged drops and ice crystals collide. Finally, the calculation of three dimensional unsteady fields of motion in the vicinity of various hydrometers will be used to interpret the experimental results. //\n",

This instrument will be initially used in five research programs: 1. Role of pigments and protein in thylakoid membrane biogenesis. 2. Analysis of synthetic amyloid peptides. 3. Structural resolution of plant anti-herbivore secondary metabolites. 4. Structural/functional relationships of protein upon gelation. 5. Structure/activity relationship in a bacterial decardoxylase. Undergraduate students participate in the above research programs during the academic year and during summer as part of the REU program. Some of the current projects involving undergraduates are: 1. Analysis of protein synthesis in the brains of salmon during smoltification. 2. Heavy metal toxicity effects on photosynthetic membranes at the level of gene expression. 3. Effect of plant secondary metabolites from forest floor litter on rates of microbial nitrification. 4. Structure a diterpene isolated from Colophospermum mophane. The spectropolarimeter will also be used in laboratory portion of undergraduate courses. This instrument will be a significant addition of the University's instrumentation capabilities. Since this will be the only spectropolarimeter available in the state, it will function as a regional instrument for users at other state campuses as well as at other University sponsored research institutes.\n",
      "a9002315 DEB $58800 Parasitoids (insect parasites that invariably kill their hosts) often aggregate their attacks where their hosts are most abundant. The degree to which attacks are aggregated, however, is highly variable--rates of parasitism (on a per victim basis) sometimes decrease with increasing host density. Mathematical models have shown that the response to the density of their hosts has profound consequences for the dynamics of the interaction. However, the mechanisms underlying aggregation are poorly understood. The proposed research is intended to examine how an aphid parasitoid alters its foraging in response to variation in host density. The goal of the research is to develop a sufficient understanding of the microscale behavior of an aphid parasitoid that can predict within-generation population-level patterns in the field. Most behavioral work to date on host- parasitoid interactions has been restricted to observations in simple laboratory environments or, if in the field, to observations of foraging on a single plant. In contrast, although population studies of host-parasitoid interactions often include information on spatial patterns, they rarely attend to the details of parasitoid behavior. This project consists of lab and field experiments closely coupled to mathematical models, which are used to extrapolate from individual behavior to patterns at the population level.\n",
      "a9002318 DEB $58800 For many sessile marine invertebrates, the larval stage is the most important mode of dispersal, and larval recruitment can directly affect the growth, survival and structure of populations. However, the nature and dynamics of larval dispersal, and thus gene flow, have been difficult to characterize. The recent development of new and rapidly applied molecular techniques may make it possible to assess dispersal by examining the genetic \"relatedness\" of populations. The PI proposes to learn and adapt molecular genetic techniques for the study of coral population genetics. The phylogenetic diversity and population structure, over large and small geographic scales, of the widely distributed brooding coral Acropora palifera will determined. Phylogeographic genotypes, along the length of the Great Barrier Reef, will be characterized by contrasting restriction endonuclease patterns of small and large subunit ribosomal DNAs in this coral with closely and distantly related corals. The relatedness of colonies from reefs in the same geographic area will also be evaluated to assess the nature of local gene flow by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of mitochondrial DNA and DNA fingerprinting.\n",
      "a9002321 DEB $58800 The DNA nucleotide base sequence of a chloroplast gene will be used to interpret phylogenetic relationships among the subclasses of the Liliopsida (i.e., the monocots). This gene encodes the large subunit of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (rbcL), part of the most abundant, and arguably, the most important protein on earth. Dr. Michael Clegg, Professor of Genetics at the University of California, Riverside, has agreed to sponsor this fellowship proposal. The rbcL gene is a particularly appropriate choice because it is ubiquitous among photoautotrophs, because it exhibits sufficient divergence for use in broad phylogenetic investigations, and because a data base of rbcL nucleotide sequences already exists which will be used in conjunction with sequence data. Contemporary sequencing technology permits the analysis of many species in a short period of time by one investigator, especially in a laboratory in which sequence analysis is conducted routinely, such as that of Dr. Clegg. Total cellular DNA will be extracted, the rbcL gene will be amplified in the polymerase chain reaction, and the nucleotide sequence will be determined by standard techniques. Sequence data will be analyzed to construct statistically supported dendrograms, It is anticipated that this research will require two years of work and support: 14-16 months will be spent procuring plant materials and determining rbcL gene sequences, and the remaining time will be devoted to analysis of the data and phylogenetic interpretation.\n",
      "a9002326 DEB $58800 Relations between forest canopy geometry, local physiological characteristics, and whole-canopy gas-exchange will be examined. The goal is understand links between individual- plant and whole-canopy physiological processes. Focus will be on effects of vertical position on plant physiological processes, to provide input values for a higher-order closure model of turbulent exchange at vegetated surfaces. The extent to which 1) canopy position can be used to predict local physiological properties and 2) canopy geometry can be used to predict canopy- level gas exchange will be examined. It is hypothesized that 1) radiation flux is a good predictor of leaf-level gas-exchange within relatively closed canopies, and 2) leaf-level physiology can be predicted by spatial position using a simple structural model. To test these hypotheses and to provide model input parameters. 1) gas-exchange characteristics as a function of vertical position will be sampled and 2) canopy radiation flux/geometry maps using photographic techniques will be constructed. The canopy-level gas-exchange model will be validated using eddy correlation. This research will be conducted in close collaboration with research groups at the University of California at Davis and the New Zealand Forest Research Institute. Field techniques will be tested in an orchard and detailed field studies will be conducted in two well- studied natural forests.\n",
      "a9002330 DEB $58800 This research examines the genetic architecture of several demographic traits and underlying physiological mechanisms in the model systems Eriogonum abertiamum, a desert annual. The work is designed to further understanding of the genetic basis for life history adaptation and of apparent evolutionary \"constraints.\" More Sonoran than Chihuahuan Desert Eriogonums begin flowering in spring, but populations in both regions retain the ancestral character of biseasonal reproduction (spring and summer). Demographic and genetic studies suggest that natural selection may explain earlier Sonoran flowering. However, retention of Biseasonality is not consistent with adaptive explanations in Sonoran populations: Expected summer fecundity does not outweigh the risk of between-season mortality. Fossil, distributional, and biogeographic evidence suggest the same conclusion. Correlations among life history traits may block selection for increased spring fecundity, as suggested by preliminary field and greenhouse studies. Selection experiments are proposed to determine a) whether heritabilities and genetic correlations among demographic traits are significantly different from zero; and b) whether selection on the correlations themselves can change their signs, i.e., whether the correlations can act as constraints. Sib analyses of growth and allocation traits--which underlie demographic traits--will examine genetic variation for these traits both within and between populations.\n",
      "a9002331 DMS $125057 This project involves the study of viscosity solutions to fully nonlinear partial differential equations. Earlier work in this area set the stage for the complete development now available for first order equations in finite dimensions, and subsequent developments in the theory of viscosity solutions of first and second-order fully nonlinear equations yielded strongly developing theories of Hamilton-Jacobi equations in infinite dimensions and fully nonlinear second order equations in finite and infinite dimensions. The present work is concerned with viscosity solutions of Hamilton-Jacobi equations in infinite dimensions, second order equations in both finite and infinite dimensions, and second order equations in the space of integrable functions. In recent years there has been a remarkable development of the theory of fully nonlinear partial differential equations of first and second order; this development followed the successful introduction of the notion of \"viscosity solutions\" of these equations which allows one to admit nowhere differentiable functions as solutions. Equations of this sort arise in many areas of mathematics and its applications, including control theory, the theory of differential games, problems of a geometrical nature, asymptotic problems, etc., etc. The pace of this development is currently at its peak, and fundamental work remains to be done to render the theory more accessible, more general, and more complete. The proposed work lies in these directions and chiefly concerns the using of the new methods to complete several aspects, including \"infinite dimensional\" versions partially motivated by the theories of control and differential games involving systems whose state lies in infinite dimensional spaces and more penetrating studies of the finer structure of viscosity solutions in both infinite and finite dimensional settings.\n",

      "a9002333 IBN $233997 One of the last major frontiers in understanding how plants function deals with their roots. The roots benefit a plant by obtaining water and nutrients from the soil and at the same time they impose a cost on the plant, which can most readily be appreciated by considering the carbon incorporated into their structure as well as expended by respiration for their growth and maintenance. Thus, the overall objective of the research is to determine the carbon requirements of water acquisition for the root systems of Agave deserti (an agave native to the southwest of the U.S.), Ferocactus acanthodes (a cactus sympatric with A. deserti), and Opuntia ficus-indica (a cactus that is cultivated worldwide as a vegetable, for cattle fodder, and for its fruits). The responses of the shoots of the three species to environmental conditions have been extensively studied in Dr. Nobel's laboratory over the past 15 years, providing valuable ecological information and also demonstrating that the productivity of O. ficus-indica exceeds that of most conventional agronomic crops. Moreover, the high productivities of such desert succulents are achieved at a very low cost in terms of transpired water, because all three species employ Crassulacean acid metabolism with its nocturnal stomatal opening and a greatly enhanced water-use efficiency. Here, the influences of temperature, soil water status, soil gas phase, and root age on root respiration and water- uptake ability will be determined for individual roots as well as entire root systems for A. deserti, F. acanthodes, and O. ficus-indica. The mechanisms for preventing water loss from the roots to a dry soil will be examined, a feature that is crucial for the survival of perennial plants in deserts. Performing cost/benefit analyses on the roots of these highly successful and productive species will not only provide basic information on how they respond in the natural environment but also can be used to propose new land-use scenarios for the beneficial exploitation of succulent plants under future climatic conditions.\n",

But the logistics of study in this region are difficult: any concerted research strategy must involve international cooperation. This proposal requests support to organize and conduct a workshop with the following goals: 1) to evaluate the relationship between sediment characteristics and climate in East African rift lakes; 2) to develop a strategy for recovering long sediment records in the rift lakes; and 3) to use them to reconstruct the 5 to 10 million year record of climate in tropical Africa. The PIs envision a decade-long research program that will involve US and international participants. The PIs will use the support from this grant to develop such a research strategy. This research is important because east Africa boasts a large portion of the world's population, dependent on an agrarian economy, so changes in the monsoon affect the lives of many people.\n",
      "a9002341 DMS $29995 This project will support research on several problems in the areas of nonlinear harmonic analysis and partial differential equations. Among the topics to be studied are the method of layer potentials for the heat equation in time-varying domains, Hardy spaces and boundary value problems for operators of Dirac type on Lipschitz domains, the characterization of the spaces of uniform holomorphy for partial sum operators for classical expansions, the calculation of the spectral radius of the trace of the double-layer potential for harmonic functions in certain domains, and applications of nonlinear harmonic analysis to problems in nonlinear partial differential equations. Nonlinear harmonic analysis emerged and developed in response to the challenges posed by difficult problems in classical analysis, particularly, but not exclusively, those arising from the study of partial differential equations. It is anticipated that applications of this work will lead to a better understanding of potential theory and the parabolic partial differential equations of heat flow.\n",
      "a9002342 DMS $36550 This award supports the research on multivariable hyper- geometric series of Professor Robert Gustafson of Texas A & M University. Dr. Gustafson has proposed to develop the theory of hypergeometric series that are very well poised on semisimple Lie algebras, as well as the corresponding theory of beta and Mellin- Barnes integrals on compact Lie groups and the associated Lie algebras. In addition, he plans to relate this theory to the families of orthogonal polynomials associated to root systems, recently defined by Macdonald. This research falls in the broad category of combinatorics, which is one of the most active fields in today's mathematics. Fundamentally, combinatorics represents a systematization of the very first of all mathematical activities, counting. In its modern development, however, combinatorics has gone beyond just counting to make use of a wide variety of advanced mathematical techniques, and although its roots go back several centuries, the field has had an explosive development in the past few decades because of its importance in communications and information technology.\n",

It will focus on the importance of meltwater percolating and freezing within snow to both the heat and mass balance of glaciers and the extent to which facies boundaries can be determined from satellites and aircraft. 2) A synthesis of existing knowledge about snow accumulation on the Greenland Ice Sheet based on data from pit studies, snow and ice cores, and meteorological stations. This will demonstrate the extent of orographic control on the distribution of snow accumulation. 3) An analysis of snow pit and core data from the summit of Mt.

One aspect of an Erdos-Renyi randomly evolving graph is a sudden appearance of the giant component, right after the moment when the average vertex degree becomes equal to 1. This research will lead to a better understanding of the likely behavior of such important extremal characteristics of the random graph as the chromatic number, the independence number and the matching number.

These include traveling wave solutions, stable steady solutions, cellular patterns, oscillatory solutions, and even solutions which behave in a chaotic manner. All of the systems which the principle investigator will consider arise as a mathematical model of a biological or chemical system. This project will consider models for combusion, chemical reactions on catalytic surfaces, phase transitions, and bursting in excitable membranes. The primary goals of this research project are to investigate through which mathematical mechanisms these patterns may arise, analyse the stability properties of each pattern, and understand what physical significance each pattern has for the underlying physical problem. The problems to be addressed in this project raise a number of fundamental mathematical issues. Of particular interest are patterns arising in more than one space dimension. Much of the analysis will be concerned with how higher dimensional patterns bifurcate from basically one dimensional objects such as planar wave solutions and radially symmetric solutions. Simple examples demonstrate that the structure of the bifurcating patterns may be incredibly complex.\n",

      "a9002353 CCR $170213 This project studies various configurations of shared busses in a Multistage Interconnection Network (MIN) based system in order to maintain cache coherence. These busses can be put separately or inside the MIN switches. It is also possible to avoid using shared busses by redesigning a MIN switch to handle broadcasting. The design and analysis of these cache coherence protocols are the research objectives of this project. A thorough analysis and comparison of various approaches can guide the future multiprocessor system designers in their design process. Multiprocessor organizations are generally defined based on their processor memory interconnections. MINs form a very suitable interconnection medium for building large scale multiprocessor systems. The efficiency of these systems can be further enhanced by putting cache memories with the processors to reduce the memory access demands. However, such cache memories give rise to inconsistency of shared data due to lack of coordination among the processors while changing their shared cache contents. A hardware solution to this problem is to broadcast the state changes through a shared bus interconnection. Since MINs do not have a shared bus, maintaining cache coherence in MIN based multiprocessors poses a serious challenge for research.\n",

It will utilize lattice theoretic and category theoretic methods to explore the general theory of these partially ordered algebraic structures. The principal investigator will also consider applications to diverse areas such as ring and monoid theory, C*-algebras, and linear logic and its use in theoretical computer science. The research in this project involves category theory and its applications to problems in theoretical computer science. Traditionally, category theory has dealt with the foundations of algebra; namely, it has focused on sets with algebraic structure, mappings between sets that preserve that structure, and even more abstract functors that relate the collections of algebraic structures and their mappings. In recent years, this research subject has enjoyed a rebirth in theoretical computer science.\n",
      "a9002365 MCB $48964 The goal of this research is to obtain temperature sensitive yeast mutants in which mRNA exit from the nucleus is blocked at the restrictive temperature. After mutagenesis of selected yeast strains, mutants will be selected through a series of screening procedures designed to eliminate those which are simply temperature sensitive for protein synthesis or amino acid uptake, and to identify those which continue to synthesize mRNA but do not allow it to exit the nucleus at the non-permissive temperature. Although transport of molecules into and out of the cell nucleus is critical for the life of a cell, the mechanisms regulating such transport are not understood. Furthermore, despite the central importance of messenger-RNA exit for all eukaryotic cells, a genetic approach to this fundamental problem of cell function has not previously been taken. Success in obtaining temperature sensitive messenger-RNA exit mutants would therefore provide important new tools that would permit analysis of the molecular basis of this process.\n",
      "a9002366 OCE $195679 This is a continuing and collaborative research effort with biologists on the hydrothermal emanations, primarily in Guaymas Basin, with follow up studies on material from the Northeastern Pacific (Middle Valley, Juan de Fuca and Gorda Ridges), African Rift Valley (Lake Tanganyika), and a hot spot under a continent (Yellowstone Park). The organic matter (petroleum) brought to the seabed by hydrothermal circulation represents the rapidly generated pyrolytic products from organic detritus at depth and is a carbon source for the hemosynthetic food web. This type of carbon cycling and its geological fate will be studied in a sedimented rift system which is hydrothermally.active, receiving primarily terrestrial organic detritus (Escanaba Trough). This will be done by coupling organic and isotope geochemistry to examine interrelationships between post.depositional pyrolytic alteration of organic matter (petroleum), biodegradation/weathering processes and chemosynthetic carbon fixation. Chemical reactions (e.g. aromatization, dehydration, isomerization) with temperature constraints also will be studied to define formation \"windows\" for different compound classes. The environmental fate of these compound classes will be examined to assess solubility, oxidative weathering and biodegradation. Key reactions and processes will be simulated in the laboratory by hydrous pyrolysis experiments. Carbon.14 dating of different organic matter fractions will place constraints on the sources and subbottom depths of the alteration of carbonaceous materials. Thus, molecular and isotopic signatures will be able to be used to trace the transfer of carbon from sources through these hydrothermal environments.\n",

His main goal is to prove a version of the Singer-Wermer conjecture generalizing his previous result proved in the commutative case. In addition he will study the structure theory of radicals in Banach algebras. Banach algebras consist of abstract objects which can be added and multiplied, but the exact form of the multiplication rule is purposely left unspecified so that the results obtained apply to very many situations. Concrete examples of Banach algebras are plentiful, and this research will help elucidate their structure.\n",

In synthetic inorganic, organic, bioinorganic and organometallic chemistry, single crystal x-ray diffraction is an invaluable tool for the characterization of molecular structure. Knowledge of molecular composition and structure helps in the development of new reactions of potentially general interest in catalysis or synthesis. This award from the Chemical Instrumentation Program will help the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Utah State University purchase a Four-Circle Automated Single Crystal X-ray Diffractometer. The instrument is needed by members of the Chemistry and Biochemistry Department for research in the following areas of chemistry: 1. Structure-reactivity studies of transition metal alpha-haloalkyl complexes. 2. Structural characterization of compounds related to metal- assisted organic synthesis; modeling of chiral transition metal catalysts. 3.

      "a9002383 CTS $160000 This proposal deals with a novel separation process recently developed that could add a valuable and powerful tool to the process designer. It is concerned with multistage countercurrent separation processes. The basic idea underlying the approach is based on using pairs of solvents that have a critical point of miscibility. By operating close to the critical point and changing the temperature of the system, one can alternatively create regions where the two solvents form homogeneous solution and others in which they separate into two distinct phases. Such solvents are already used in separations, but at present they are used far from the critical point of miscibility. By operating across the critical point in each section, the mass transfer in the mixing zone as well as the coalescence process is facilitated. This allows design with low intensity of mixing, and this will be useful for separations in which there is a tendency to emulsification or foaming due to impurities. It is also suitable for separation of high molecular weight compound which have low diffusivities and therefore high mass transfer resistance. This allows some novel design options and will allow separations which are at present not economically feasible with existing solvent separation methods. The basic concept has been demonstrated and a small column has been successfully operated. However, in order to apply these processes in an efficient way, a better understanding of the scientific principles involved is required. The goal of this proposal is to provide understanding, as well as to provide a better scientific base for future design.\n",
      "a9002391 ATM $117400 The destructive power of tornadoes is well known, but the exact dynamical processes that cause the formation and maintenance of tornadoes is not yet completely understood. The Principal Investigator will use a numerical model to study the dynamics of the air flow in and around a tornado vortex with a concentration on the region that would be below cloud base in an actual thunderstorm. The Principal Investigator will utilize, for the first time in a study of this type, advanced numerical techniques that allow the model to adjust its resolution as the model runs. This provides fine resolution only in the areas where it is most needed. Additionally, most previous studies of vortices, whether laboratory, numerical or theoretical, have assumed symmetry of the environmental flow. The Principal Investigator will be able to relax this assumption which will provide the ability to study these vortices under a variety of environmental conditions.\n",

      "a9002397 DMS $102042 The source of this mathematical research is a conjecture made by W. Thurston five years ago to the effect that if one packed circles inside planar simply connected domains and then associated the circles by a discrete map, then as the circles became smaller, the maps would converge to the analytic Riemann map between the two domains. Several proofs of the conjecture followed shortly thereafter. This project continues the study of connections between circle packings and analytic functions, with the aim of developing a geometrically faithful discrete analogue of parts of classical function theory. Initial developments in the application of circle packing relied on hexagonal packings. For reasons both aesthetic and practical, this restriction is being removed. Deeper insights into the fundamental behavior of circle packings is expected to result from this work. A departure from studies of circle packing in the plane to the setting of hyperbolic geometry is also leading to new connections between combinatorics and geometry. What has already emerged, for example, are hyperbolic analogues for the Schwarz lemma and Pick lemma in the context of circle packing maps. A new element recently introduced into these studies is that of using a random walk as a perspective from which to view the transition from one packing to the next. This model shows, for instance, how the effects of differential changes in boundary radii distribute themselves about the packing. The precision of the model is exact, reflecting the profound rigidity in circle packings. The first and most important goal of this work will be to determine the corresponding result of the Mostow rigidity theorem: Are infinite circle packings which fill the hyperbolic plane unique up to automorphisms? Work will also be done to answer the question of which compact surfaces support circle packings.\n",
      "a9002399 DMI $250000 The application of high temperature superconductors (HTSC) in electronics requires a cost-effective deposition process capable of growing epitaxial, in-situ superconducting thin films below 650oC. Metalorganic Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD) has the potential to meet this need; however, it is currently limited by the high temperatures required to decompose the intermediates formed by the decomposition of Group II source reagents. The research will provide a fundamental understanding of the barium chemistry occurring at the growth interface which will facilitate the low temperature preparation of HTSC thin films. If low growth temperatures can be realized, the development of a manufacturing process should rapidly follow based on CVD's inherent advantages in large area uniformity and ease of scale- up.\n",
      "a9002400 CHE $149700 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to the chemist for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. This award from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program will help the Chemistry Department of the RUI institution, Franklin & Marshall College, to acquire, operate and maintain a high-field NMR spectrometer. The acquisition of the instrument will enhance the ability of the Department to prepare undergraduates for possible careers in chemistry and will enhance research in the following areas: a) The determination of equilibrium constants, stoichiometry, and structures of Lewis adducts of model organometallic halides of Groups 14 and 15 b) The determination of the structural determinants of organometallic tautomerism and higher coordination c) Thermal rearrangements of bicyclic vinylcyclobutances and stereoselective syntheses of substituted norbornanones and norbornenones and, d) Investigations of infrared laser-induced organic reactions. The instrument will also be used in ongoing collaborative projects with neighboring institutuions such as the determination of substituent effects in phosphineborane organometallics.\n",
      "a9002401 ATM $647877 The primary goal of this project is to conduct an intercomparison on the measurement of sulfur gases in the air between various research groups who are measuring the gases. These gases are of major atmospheric importance, but at this time we do not know if the different analytical instrumentation and methods are equivalent in their measurement capability. This is due to the variety of preconcentration methods and equipment which are used to measure the gases and to the high reactivity of these sulfur gases with a variety of chemical species in the air, water, soils, etc. This proposal is an omnibus proposal to provide for the logistical support to perform the intercomparison and to analyze the data generated from the intercomparison. The experimental design is such that both laboratory and field exercises will be performed and that the range of concentration for intercalibration of each gas will be from about five times the minimum detectable limit of each gas to two orders of magnitude higher. This range will cover the range of natural measurements (part per trillion by volume to part per billion by volume) and provide an experiment which can provide for good statistical validity in the intercomparison. A successful intercomparison, with the validation of several research groups to measure sulfur gases, will result in the ability to perform coordinated research projects to understand the vital role of sulfur in global climate change.\n",
      "a9002406 BCS $2650 ABSTRACT Causative and Restructuring constructions have played a central role in Romance linguistics. These constructions hold a special interest because they seem to behave in some respects like complex sentences (biclauses) and in other respects like simple sentences (monoclauses). This dual behavior has proved difficult for current syntactic theory to account for in a principled fashion. The claim explored here is that the biclausal properties of Causative and Restructuring constructions can be accounted for within a purely monoclausal analysis-that is, an analysis that treats these constructions purely as simple sentences. This dissertation project develops such an approach for Spanish. Among the analytic issues addressed are: the interaction of Restructuring with passive, the interaction of Causative with reflexives; and the syntax of Restructuring constructions formed from psychological verbs. Because many of the revelant facts have not yet been documented, this project constitutes a contribution to the description of Spanish syntax as well as to the analysis of a theoretically recalcitrant construction.\n",
      "a9002413 IIS $170069 To be considered intelligent, machines must be capable of learning. Symbolic and neural approaches to machine learning both have been heavily investigated. However, there has been little research into the synergies achievable by combining these two learning paradigms. This work will develop a hybrid system that combines the symbolically-oriented explanation-based learning paradigm with the neural back-propagation algorithm. In this system, the initial neural network configuration is determined by the generalized explanation of the solution to a specific classification of planning task. This research addresses the problem of choosing a good initial neural network configuration and overcomes problems that arise when using imperfect theories to build explanations. Most real-world problems can never be formalized exactly. However, there is much to be gained by utilizing the capability to reason approximately correctly. Explanation-based learning provides a way to profitably use casual models of the world, while neural networks provide a way to refine roughly-correct concepts. This research on combining these two learning paradigms promises to broaden the applicability of machine learning techniques, producing learning algorithms that are not brittle and which can produce concepts whose accuracy improves through experience.\n",
      "a9002416 DMS $15000 This project will support a postdoc working with the principal investigator on two important and difficult problems of mathematical physics: the stability of atomic and molecular systems and the number of parameters needed to describe a stationary black hole. The first problem concerns the number of electrons that can exist in stable atoms and molecules; the second problem concerns the correctness of the assumption that the mass and the angular momentum together describe a stationary black hole. Mathematical physicists very often use the same or similar ideas to study very small and very large physical systems. This proposal will study just how many electrons can exist in a stable atom or molecule (a very small system governed by the laws of quantum mechanics) and whether the mass and the angular momentum of a stationary black hole determine its structure (a very large system governed by the laws of general relativity).\n",
      "a9002420 DMS $114000 This project continues work on modern aspects of Fourier analysis related to wavelet theory, weighted inequalities for the Fourier transform and restriction theorems for the transform. Weighted Fourier transform inequalities are motivated by some of the central issues of signal processing. In linear system theory, weights correspond to various filters in energy concentration problems. Another area of application, prediction theory, weighted Lebesgue spaces arise for weights corresponding to power spectra of stationary stochastic processes. The object of the research is to obtain bounds on the q-th power norm of the weighted Fourier transform in terms of the weighted p-th power norm of the signal (original function). The program seeks best possible estimates. This search gives rise to uncertainty principle inequalities; these provide natural constraints for determining the effectiveness of spectrum estimation techniques used in signal processing. The methods of wavelet theory play a basic role in this activity. Initial efforts will focus on the special case of quadratic (weighted) norms. Inequalities may be obtained when information concerning the (integrals of) decreasing rearrangements of the weights can be computed. The same condition obtains without rearranging the weights when the inequalities are valid. What needs to be worked out is what happens between the necessary and sufficient conditions. Techniques derived from balayage combined with atomic decompositions of underlying tent spaces will be employed in efforts to clarify the different conditions.\n",
      "a9002423 DMS $31600 The principal investigator will work on two major problems in the area of nonparametric regression: multivariate smoothing and variance function estimation. For the smoothing of surfaces, without any restrictions like additivity of the function or other assumptions to reduce dimensionality, an approach based on mixtures between an orthogonal series method using ultraspherical expansions and kernel estimators is to be developed. The main problems to be analyzed are the choice of bandwidths, boundary effects and their treatment, associated questions of uniform convergence, the estimation of isoklines and the development of fast and efficient algorithms. In his work on nonparametric variance function estimation he will develop methods for constructing confidence and prediction intervals of the variance. The nonparametric analysis of curve data has found considerable interest among statisticians facing applied problems from longitudinal biomedical studies as well as geophysical and environmental spatial data. The principal investigator will work on two specific problems in this area: surface fitting and variance function estimation.\n",
      "a9002428 CCR $106598 Recursive query languages such as Datalog make \"knowledge-base\" systems highly expressive. However, such languages are difficult to compile into efficient code. This project will combine work on high level program transformations with techniques developed for logic databases to produce a Datalog compiler that will give cleaner and more efficient code than has been currently reported. In particular, transformations will be used that translate systems of fixed point equations into procedural programs that are further improved by finite differencing (a transformation that uncovers and implements critical invariants). The resulting code would then be amenable to more conventional optimization techniques. Two other related problems will be investigated, (1) to give the compiler the capability to analyze performance mechanically; and (2) to incrementally compute relations recursively defined in Datalog clauses.\n",
      "a9002429 DMS $10000 This research will lie in the area of mathematical statistics and will concern bootstrap methodology. The bootstrap methodology was introduced by Efron in 1979 and is being increasingly used in statistical inference in a wide variety of situations. The method is simple, generally applicable both in parametric and nonparametric problems, and has great potential to be an important tool in extracting information from data. This research is aimed at examining the existing techniques and working out modified or alternative techniques which lead to more efficient results. The bootstrap method is highly computational and this grant supports computer equipment to continue work in this area of statistics. In addition to this equipment support, the principal investigator is supported by the Army Research Office and the Air Force Office of Scientific Research.\n",
      "a9002431 DMS $12852 This project supports mathematical research on problems arising in the study of dynamical systems and differential equations. The equations are functional differential equations of retarded type. In certain equations occurring in biological models, the retardation of memory effect is a natural feature. Work will focus on four main topics. The first concerns monotone flows on monotone dynamical systems. Efforts to modify standard systems theory to present a unified treatment of differential equations for which the set of equilibrium points contains all (phase space) constant functions will be made. The second topic relates to instability of physical systems. Applications of invariance principles of finite delay equations will be made to obtain instability results for finite and infinite delay functional differential equations. Instability is characterized by the property that all solutions passing near an unstable point must leave every neighborhood of the point. Neutral functional differential equations make up the third element of this project. Work will be done in establishing comparison-convergence techniques for approximating solutions. The final goal of the research is that of using monotone iteration techniques to study periodic boundary value problems for functional differential equations. Both the existence of periodic solutions and techniques for constructing them will be considered.\n",

The holdings of this herbarium probably constitute the world's best representation of the plants of this area. This collection has been used extensively for preparation of the Intermountain Flora and the Flora of Utah, and this herbarium is the primary resource for our understanding of the transition between the floras of the Rocky Mountains to the east and the Great Basin to the West. Research on the biogeography of the American West benefits greatly from this collection. Dr. Stanley Welsh, Curator of the Herbarium, has been responsible for the collection's steady growth over the past decades, and he now proposes to install a new storage system of movable \"compatorized\" herbarium cases. This improvement will support many years of continued growth of the collection. Natural history collections such as the Brigham Young Herbarium constitute the a valuable resource for understanding the diversity of life on earth. They are indispensable to research in many fields of science, including but not limited to systematic and evolutionary biology, ecology, biogeography, and conservation. The continued support and improvement of these collections will provide future generations of investigators with access to critical research resources.\n",
      "a9002442 BES $227552 The objective of this project are to identify and quantify chemical reaction products when chlorine is used to disinfect wastewater treatment plant effluents. Special emphasis in this project is on reactions between nitrogenous organic compounds such as the amino acids and peptides in the effluents with chlorine. Spectral techniques are planned to be used for identification of the chlorination products, in the process of characterizing their stability and to determine how conventional methods of analysis respond to the presence of these compounds. Chlorination is relied on heavily in the United States for disinfection of effluents prior to their placement in environmental waters. Chlorine is known to react with organic compounds to form products many of which have not been fully characterized with respect to their environmental significance for downstream water users. Results of this project are expected to provide the basis for any changes that may be necessary in engineering design and use of chlorination to avoid or eliminate environmental problems associated with use of this process.\n",
      "a9002446 CHE $433700 This project in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division studies the fundamentals of solvation, the interaction of additives with liquids. Solvation properties affect reaction rates and the course of reactions. When two or more solvents interact, separation of components is based on competitive solvation properties. Prof. Carr has been developing general descriptions of solvation, and this work extends his earlier explorations. Solvation properties are organized based on Kamlet-Taft scales of dipolarity, hydrogen bond acidity, and basicity. Gas and liquid chromatography will be used to measure solvation parameters, and then new chromatography columns will be evaluated based on knowledge of the previously measured parameters. Extension to characterization of reversed phase liquid chromatography will be made. Free energy scales for solvation as a function of acidity and basicity parameters will be established.\n",

This project is a continuation of theoretical and model development research to further study the chaotic properties of various magnetotail models and the application of these models to tail energization processes. The project is described in four main areas of research pertinent to the role of stochastic particle orbits in magnetotail dynamics and the correct time scale for collisionless resistivity. These include studies of the irreversible behavior of current sheets and neutral line fields, the stochasticity of particle orbits, the response of ensembles of charged particles, diffusion coefficients and their dependence on model parameters, all directed towards understanding the evolution of particle distributions from the plasma sheet boundary layer to the central plasma sheet. ***//\n",
      "a9002448 EAR $99899 This research will use quantitative methods to discriminate tectonic from eustatic components of sea level change during deposition of Pennsylvanian cyclothems of North America and Northwest Europe. Techniques to be used include (1) quantitative tectonic subsidence analysis, back-stripped with corrections for compaction, sediment load, paleodepth and sea level change, (2) calculation of tectonic plate stress and its effect on sea level change, and (3) determination of the present-day elevation of Pennsylvanian shoreline sediments so as to identify Pennsylvanian paleo-sealevel on a stable reference datum. New criteria of the preserved position of sea level (so-called \"sea level markers\") in coastal sedimentary rocks are available now to constrain the range of such determinations. Paleodepths can be identified from this datum by measuring the decompacted thickness of vertical sequences of shoreline facies. The decompacted thickness of barrier island and tidal flat vertical sequences provides a numerical estimate of the magnitude of eustatic change in sea level, and will be used to make the eustatic sea level correction for tecotnic subsidence analysis. Expected results include determining the exact present-day elevation of Pennsylvanian sea level, and the numerical magnitude of both eustatic and tectonic components of Pennsylvanian sea level change. The approach to be tested herein can then be used to make similar determinations of eustatic and tectonic controls on sea level in sedimentary rocks representing other periods of earth history.\n",

Some questions will continue data series previously collected for NSF, while others will introduce new topical areas. Some questions will also be designed to be used in conjunction with similar surveys in other countries. NSF has been collecting data in this area since 1972.

Dr. Wiles plans to continue his researches in Iwasawa Theory by examining the symmetric square of a representation associated to a certain class of Hecke eigenforms. In this way, he hopes to attack the Greenberg conjectures, which concern the newly defined Selmer groups of compatible families of L-adic representations. This is research in the field of arithmetic algebraic geometry, a subject that combines the techniques of algebraic geometry and number theory. In its original formulation, algebraic geometry treated figures that could be defined in the plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Number theory started with the whole numbers and such questions as divisibility of one whole number by another. These two subjects, seemingly so far apart, have in fact influenced each other from the earliest times, but in the past quarter century the mutual influence has increased greatly. The field of arithmetic algebraic geometry now uses techniques from all of modern mathematics, and is having corresponding influence beyond its own borders.\n",
      "a9002469 DMS $32203 This research explores various applications of the extension theorems and commutant lifting theorems for contraction operators on Krein spaces. Some of these problems, such as the Krein space formulation of Foias' generalization of an interpolation problem of Dym and Gohberg, are natural restatements of classical Hilbert space problems. Other of these problems, such as the study of maximal negative subspaces of bicontractive operators, make sense only within the context of indefinite inner product spaces. This research is in the general area of modern analysis. Its focus is on the commutant lifting theorems for certain classes of operators on Krein spaces. For Hilbert space contractions, the lifting theorem has been well known since the late 1960's and has been a powerful tool in areas such as classical interpolation theory and in corona theory.\n",

Furthermore, the study of singularities in gauge fields will be extended to arbitrary compact Lie groups and to more general singular sets of codimension-two. Lastly, the Morse theory of hyperbolic monopoles will be investigated and related to that of instantons on the four-sphere. This project involves the use of advanced analysis to understand aspects of modern mathematical physics. In many respects this is a golden era in the technical interaction between physics and the mathematical areas of differential geometry and partial differential equations. This interplay, which goes back to Einstein and Gauss, was recently intensified by work of Donaldson who showed that our four-dimensional space- time could have different shape than earlier assumed.\n",

      "a9002486 DMS $34000 This research is concerned with the algebraic K-groups of infinite fields. The principal investigator is studying aspects of the geometric significance of some filtration quotients of these K-groups. These quotients bring together various fields of mathematical research including the homology of the general linear group, the higher Chow groups of Bloch and certain scissors congruence groups of polytopes. Algebraic geometry is the study of the geometric objects arising from the sets of zeros of systems of polynomial equations. This is one of the oldest and currently one of the most active branches of mathematics. There are widespread applications of algebraic geometry in mathematics, physics and computer science.\n",
      "a9002487 DMR $210000 Research on chemical reactions on miscible polymer blends is an area in which the opportunities for morphological control on top of chemical reactivity have important implications in regard to final materials properties, especially in polymer blends having critical solution temperatures where changes in reaction temperature affect miscibility, phase separation, and chemical reactivity. Oxidative studies will be carried out on miscible blends of poly(styrene) (PS) and poly(vinyl methyl ether) (PVME). PVME photo-oxidizes and thermo-oxidizes much more readily than polystyrene -- allowing for large differences in reactivity with oxygen. Prior studies have indicated that the rates of oxygen uptake by the homopolymers are significantly different than that of the blends. The research will involve - understanding the mechanistic chemical aspects of the oxidative stabilization phenomena for PS/PVME blends by use of model compounds, additional studies on the degradation products directly obtained from their oxidation experiments on the polymer systems, the effect of specific interactions such as hydrogen bonding on miscibility and oxidative aging in these systems, extension of these concepts into other systems, and the effect of added antioxidants and their distribution.\n",

      "a9002491 DMR $161500 The objective of this research is to study experimentally the plasma oscillations in the electron gas confined in wide, remotely-doped AlGaAs heterostructure wells. This novel solid state plasma, with a spatially-tunable density distribution and with sufficiently high elctron mobilities, presents the opportunity to observe well-defined plasmas for temperatures below and well above the degeneracy temperature (approximately 20 K). These systems have the advantage that the potential that confines the electrons is smooth on the scale of the Thomas-Fermi screening length, meaning results can be compared with \"jellium\" theories that are not complicated by the strong, rapidly varying ionic potentials in bulk semiconductors and metallic plasmas. The PI plans to use visible-light scattering and far-infrared spectroscopy to probe the effects of density gradients in the electron layer on the plasma modes.\n",

The investigators intend to address the issue of how do peasant households reproduce themselves, not only biologically, but economically and socially as well, in the fact of adverse conditions posed by the expansion of the market. Data collected in the Central Valley of Oaxaca, Mexico will permit a diachronic and a synchronic analysis of the effect of external factors (e.g., market) on internal household structure and organization--the reverse of Chayanov's model in which internal needs determine peasant production. Data include genealogies and work and reproductive histories to be summed in matrices by chronological year and household age. Results will show changes in consumer/ worker ratio, division of labor, expulsion or retention of household members (via marriage or migration), changing productive and subsistence activities, and demographic behavior. The collaborators have experience with the field training of graduate and undergraduate students in Anthropology. Such training will be an integral part of this research as much of the data collecting and analysis will be performed by graduate and undergraduate students in Mexico and the United States.\n",

      "a9002521 INT $10592 This award will support collaborative research in sociology on the topic of comparative U.S. and British civic response to child sexual abuse. The investigators are Dr. Thomas Frothingham, Duke University Medical Center and Dr. C.J. Hobb, St. James University Hospital, Leeds, England. In the county of Cleveland, England in 1987, diagnoses of child sexual abuse increased suddenly, and within a few months, more than 100 children were removed from their homes. Public outcry and Parliamentary inquiry resulted in an extensive national examination of all the arrangements for dealing with child abuse in England. There are striking parallels between what has happened suddenly in England and more gradually in Durham, North Carolina and other areas in the U.S. Change in civic response in the U.S. is urgently needed but is proceeding slowly at best. In this project, Dr. Frothingham proposes to study in collaboration with Dr. Hobb the changes now occurring in England in the aftermath of the Cleveland experience. Specifically, the following will be examined: 1) arrangements for the detection and management of sexually abused children and their families 2) intra- agency structure and function, i.e. medical organizations, social services, police, judiciary and private agencies. 3) inter-agency collaboration and 3) the effect of the Cleveland experience on current practices and recent changes. The proposed research project is a significant opportunity to gather data on a critical social problem in the U.S. Since England provides wide range of social supports not available to any but the poorest sector in the U.S., the cross-cultural data will be especially valuable.The results of this research will provide a greater understanding of the linkages between the detection and handling of child abuse and the promotion of family stability.\n",

Secondly, the principal investigator will attempt to apply the methods developed in that work to prove a stable version of Barratt's exponent conjecture. Finally, the principal investigator will continue his work with Ross Staffeldt on Topological Hochschild Homology and Waldhausen K-theory. To summarize, a variety of efforts will be pursued to explore, to perfect, and to apply sophisticated algebraic techniques in order better to understand and classify topological (i.e., a kind of geometric) structures.\n",
      "a9002529 DMS $50300 The topological properties of an algebraic variety (the set of solutions of some polynomial equations) will be studied in two ways, using structures which are special to them. First, there are notions of size and distance on the smooth part of an algebraic variety, inherited from its imbedding in space. Using this, one defines square-summable functions and, more generally, differential forms on the smooth part of the variety. The first problem to be studied is to what extent the periods of these functions or forms are determined by the topological properties of the variety, in particular, by a topological invariant called \"the intersection homology group.\" The second problem is to find ways to relate quantitative measures of the intersection of cycles on the variety with its local topological properties. These geometrical investigations will not be confined to the non-singular case, rendering them more difficult, yet more suitable of application to spaces which arise in theoretical physics and in other analytic theories.\n",

This work will be carried out at California State University, Fullerton (a predominantly undergraduate institution), and in collaboration with the Basic and Applied Science Group at Caltech and the Surface Physics Group at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Our aims are two-fold. Namely, to extend the fundamental understanding of ion-surface collision phenomena, and to guide future experimental work in this area.\n",
      "a9002536 CHE $471250 This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program of the Chemistry Division and the Polymers Program of the Division of Materials Research supports the continuing work of Professor Green and Dr. Levon at the Polytechnic University. The results of this research will give new understanding and insight to the right or left hand helical nature of polymers. The factors that control the preferential formation of right- or left- handed helices will be explored. Since bio-polymers, such as peptides and DNA, can exist in right- or left- handed helices, this work is of particular interest. Drs. Green and Levon will provide new and important information in three areas, of which all are related to how the chirality of the monomers effect the helical chirality of the polymers. In the first area, the effect of a chiral center on the chiral helicity of isocyanate polymers will be studied. It has been found that a chiral center by virtue of deuterium substitution in R-1- deuteriohexylisocyanate had a profound effect on the helical chirality of the polyisocyanate. This observation will be studied further as well as the helical chirality of the polymer resulting from R-2-deuteriohexylisocyanate. In the second area, a study will be made of the relationship between helical twist of a side chain containing a biphenyl group in an N-carboxyanhydride monomer and helicity of the polyglutamate polymer. In the third area, the gelation of polyisocyanides as function of the stereochemistry of the monomer will be investigated.\n",
      "a9002538 DMS $168450 This award supports the research in number theory of Professors Carl Pomerance and Helmut Maier of the University of Georgia. Dr. Pomerance's research will center on integer factoring algorithms and studies of the distribution in arithmetic progressions of integers with no large prime factor as well as properties of the sequence of divisors of an integer. Dr Maier's project is to continue his work on irregularities in the distribution of prime numbers in short intervals, and also to study the coefficients of the cyclotomic polynomials. Except for counting, number theory, which is the study of the properties of the whole numbers, is the oldest branch of mathematics. In modern days, problems in number theory have furnished the driving force to creation of new mathematics in the fields of pure algebra, analysis, and geometry; some of the most recent and most astonishing applications of number theory have appeared in theoretical computer science and coding theory.\n",

      "a9002541 DMS $61000 Work on this project combines geometry and function theory in several complex variables to study how the geometry of a domain influences the properties of holomorhpic functions defined on the domain. Although progress has been made recently in understanding domains whose complex geometry is not excessively degenerate, so-called domains of finite type, the general state of knowledge is still limited. Among the most manageable classes of holomorphic functions defined on a domain, those which are square integrable are probably the most useful. It is possible to convert any square integrable function on a domain into its nearest holomorphic neighbor by a process of integration against a kernel function - the Bergman kernel. There is a unique such kernel for each domain and integration projects each function onto the best holomorphic approximant. Perhaps the most important question related to holomorphic functions on domains is that of determining whether or not the projection preserves functions which are differentiable on the boundary of the domain. Are their images also differentiable on the boundary? Even experienced mathematicians would consider the likelihood of such an event an accident. The facts are otherwise. If the boundary has a smooth, curved shape (pseudoconvex) then the projections are always differentiable. Work will continue in an effort to extend present results to domains which are not pseudoconvex. Among the more tractable domains to be analyzed are the Hartogs domains. These are domains possessing some circular symmetry. Several counterexamples in function theory have been found in Hartogs domains. Ultimately, this work will be applied to the general problem of analyzing biholomorphic mappings between domains in several complex variables. These maps are known to have smooth extensions to the respective boundaries in many instances. A complete description of the domains for which these smooth extensions exist is probably the most important question under investigation in several complex variables at this time.\n",

      "a9002546 CCR $198692 This investigation is concerned with automated theorem proving in the typed lambda calculus and with properties of the lambda calculus. The typed lambda calculus is a formulation of higher-order logic well suited to the formalization of mathematics and other disciplines. The lambda calculus is both a logical theory and a model of computation. It is fundamental to both higher-type theorem proving and functional programming language design. Previous research has shown that one can search for a proof of a theorem of typed lambda calculus by searching for an expansion proof in natural deduction style. Research will continue on methods for finding expansion proofs, on various aspects of the lambda calculus, and on related problems and questions. Development of an existing computerized theorem proving system called TPS will continue. It will be enhanced as a practical and convenient tool for investigating methods of searching for expansion proofs, translating back and forth between expansion proofs and natural deduction proofs, and constructing and checking formal proofs interactively, semi-automatically, and automatically.\n",

The extension expands the research scope; it also provides an opportunity to reanalyze the extensive quantity of laboratory experimental data obtained during the past five years of research. The motivation for this extension arises from the results obtained previously. The objective is to develop a thorough understanding of the fundamental behavior of broken tsunami (bore) propagation up a sloping beach; the tsunami actions at the shore; and the ensuing runup and drawdown processes. These phenomena are fundamental to an understanding of the destructive effect of a tsunami as it reaches a coastal zone.\n",

This project is in the general area of statistics and focuses on high speed computing. The spline function models need new statistical and numerical techniques to let the data select from among various possible models, to fit these models, and to provide as much information as possible on how accurate the model forecast are likely to be. Most of this research is supported by AFSOR and NASA. This award supports a graduate student to work in the project.\n",

Among the causes of formwork failure are inadequate strength and overloading. The proposed study will concentrate on developing probability models for predicting the resistances and stiffnesses of handset wood slab formworks commonly used in multistory concrete construction. The behavior of a formwork system is not only a function of the strength and the physical condition of its members but also the quality of its installation workmanship. Therefore, to develop formwork load-deformation and resistance models, samples of formwork members and form installation workmanship data will be collected from several construction sites. Each collected member sample will be erected in the lab for test with the same installation deviations and inaccuracies measured for it at the construction site. The tests results will be used to derive probability models expressing the resistance and stiffness of wood formworks.\n",

Both of these projects are related to the arithmetic of automorphic forms and Shimura varieties. This is research in the field of arithmetic algebraic geometry, a subject that combines the techniques of algebraic geometry and number theory. In its original formulation, algebraic geometry treated figures that could be defined in the plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Number theory started with the whole numbers and such questions as divisibility of one whole number by another. These two subjects, seemingly so far apart, have in fact influenced each other from the earliest times, but in the past quarter century the mutual influence has increased greatly. The field of arithmetic algebraic geometry now uses techniques from all of modern mathematics, and is having corresponding influence beyond its own borders.\n",
      "a9002577 DMS $339813 In addition to the mathematical aspects of the work, the project has the potential for wide impact on the scientific community through the development of a comprehensive computer environment for the exploration of dynamical systems. The intention is to provide the user of this environment with interactive, efficient access to all currently available algorithms for studying the dynamics of general systems together with the tools for effectively managing the data produced in these studies. A prototype for such an environment has been developed in the context of the first problem listed above, but further work is required to produce a package that meets the needs of a broad spectrum of applications and users. These further developments will occur in conjunction with studies of problems of significant theoretical interest.\n",
      "a9002579 DMS $76160 Professors Varadarajan and Babbitt will work on a variety of projects. The first is a joint project involving the study of differential equations in a broad framework which relates them to algebraic groups and their representations. The questions to be studied have broad significance in such areas as differential modules over schemes, moduli of vector bundles, theory of algebraic groups, asymptotic analysis, and invariant differential operators and distributions. Other projects involve representation theory of the Poincare group, and scattering theory in the quantum Heisenberg model. The joint project focuses on the behavior of solutions to differential equations with singularities as a function of external parameters. The other projects fall under the heading of mathematical physics and involve mathematical aspects of quantum theory.\n",
      "a9002585 INT $2000 This award provides modest partial support to facilitate a sabbatical visit to Denmark by Professor Jeffry V. Mallow of Loyola University of Chicago. His host will be Professor Karin Beyer of Roskilde University Center, Roskilde, Denmark. They share a background in physics and a research interest in the sociology and psychology of science education, particularly the phenomenon of science avoidance by women. Dr. Mallow developed a clinic based program to address science avoidance, while Dr. Beyer's work has emphasized the modification of classroom interactions. Semester-long reciprocal visits will permit them to pursue joint research in this important field. They plan to examine data already acquired on the respective techniques, and to investigate which aspects are transferable to the school system of the other country. They also intend to investigate the development of a hybrid technique combining the science anxiety clinic with classroom intervention. Gender differences in the decision to study science and mathematics have been recognized for many years. There is a substantial body of literature now on reactions to mathematics, but less so for the sciences. Some progress has been made in seeking ways to change girls' avoidance of science. Recognition and study of the problem has become internationalized, and results of the research have begun to find application both in the classroom and in the training of teachers. The collaborators in the curent proposal are among those actively seeking to advance this field, where exchanges of experience have proven to be quite valuable.\n",
      "a9002587 DMS $59241 The study of 3-dimensional topology is often enriched by imposing extra structure on 3-manifolds. A recent construction due to Gabai shows that a 3-manifold supports many interesting dynamical systems, namely pseudo-Anosov flows. The first two parts of this project aim towards showing that dynamical systems on a 3-manifold can be used to give complete information about an important topological invariant, the Thurston norm on homology. The main work of the first part will be to show that Gabai's flows are well-behaved enough to determine completely the Thurston norm. The second part will focus on explicitly constructing these flows, so as to have an efficient algorithm for computing the norm. A bonus will be a method for efficient computation of complete homeomorphism invariants of 3-manifolds which fiber over the circle. The third and final part of this project addresses a long range goal, to investigate the conjecture that every 3-manifold which is irreducible and contains a non-separating surface has a finite cover which fibers over the circle. Dynamical systems are potentially useful for this investigation, due to work of Fried. Mosher will attempt to prove the conjecture for some simple examples which are \"as close as possible\" to fibering without actually fibering. If successful, this may yield suggestions for an attack on the conjecture in general.\n",
      "a9002588 DMS $110855 The principal investigators will work on some problems in modeling financial markets. The work will include contingent claim pricing, utility maximization and equilibrium existence and characterization in securities markets which exhibit various kinds of incompleteness. Securities are modelled as Ito processes. Incompleteness in these models can arise because there are too few securities to hedge all the risk associated with the underlying Brownian motion, because there are constraints on admissible portfolios such as short-selling prohibition, or because of transaction costs. The problem with different interest rates for borrowing and investing will also be examined.\n",
      "a9002594 DMS $47300 The investigator intends to focus on classifying certain kinds of manifolds using a combination of geometric methods and stable homotopy theory. In particular, he would like to find necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of positive scalar curvature metrics, and give a diffeomorphism classification of Dupin hypersurfaces and complete intersections. Classification of manifolds with nice geometric properties is as old as the Greeks. Here the properties under consideration are more modern, but the basic idea is much the same.\n",
      "a9002597 AST $100000 A Focal Plane Array Autocorrelation Spectrometer (FAAS) will be built in order to realize the full potential of a 15 element array receiver at the Five College Radio Astronomy Observatory (FCRAO). This 16,384 channel autocorrelator will utilize correlator chips developed by the Netherlands Foundation for Research in Astronomy. The fundamental clock rate of the correlator is 40MHz. The FAAS will provide 1024 spectral channels, with 20MHz bandwidth, for each of the elements of the array receiver. The FAAS spectrometer can time multiplex the input signal to achieve 200km/sec of bandwidth and approximately 1km/sec resolution for the CO J=1-0 transition. The FAAS is designed to operate also as a hebrid spectrometer for a single receiver. With approximately 15000 channels per receiver bandwidth.\n",
      "a9002601 INT $4180 This proposal requests funds to permit Dr. Hong H. Lee, Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Florida, to pursue with Dr. Sang Heup Moon, Reaction Engineering Laboratory, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), for a period of 18 months, a program of cooperative research on the effects of pore size on deactivation of nickel catalysts for benzene hydrogenation. These catalysts are affected both by sintering and coking (poisoning) due to the exothermic nature of the reaction. The objective of the research is to determine the effects of pore size on the deactivation rate so that a nickel catalyst can be designed for an extended lifetime for the hydrogenation reaction. In the cooperative project, Dr. Moon will prepare and test catalysts of varying support pore size. Dr. Lee will provide a theoretical analysis of the effect of support pore size on the sintering of these metal catalysts. Because the catalyst is affected both by sintering and coking, a determination also must be made as to how much of the deactivation is due to sintering in order to properly analyze data on catalyst effectiveness. In addition to the importance of the project as a basic research study, this research may have important applications in industrial catalysis, where the effectiveness of the catalyst is inversely related to the extent of sintering. The collaborators are highly respected scientists in the field of this research. The present project will allow them to combine their talents and interests for mutual benefit. This project is relevant to the objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program which seeks to increase the level of cooperation between U.S. and Korean scientists and engineers through the exchange of scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through collaboration on problems of mutual benefit. Korean participation in the project is supported by the Korea Science and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).\n",
      "a9002603 INT $11756 This proposal requests funds to permit Dr. Gregory R. Carmichael, Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, University of Iowa, to pursue with Dr. Min Sun Hong, Department of Environmental Engineering, Ajou University, Korea, for a period of 24 months, a program of cooperative research on the long range transport of air pollutants in the Pacific Rim region around South Korea. The research plan includes observation and modelling components. Background measurements of aerosol, ozone, and oxides of nitrogen and of sulfur will be obtained at Cheju Island located south-southwest of the Korean peninsula. Comprehen- sive modelling analysis of the long range transport of pollutants and their impact on the environment will be made. Chemicals released into the atmosphere can have many adverse impacts on the environment including local air pollution such as smog, regional problems such as acid rain, and global problems including the reduction of stratospheric ozone and global warming. South Korea's location between China, to the west, and Japan, to the east, provides an ideal location to study the transport and chemical charac- teristics of the east Asia plume. This research is of interest and benefit to the United States because it has now been well established that neither pollutants nor their effects are confined to the locations where the chemicals enter the atmosphere. The two investigators are outstanding scientists in the field of the project who have a record of successful collaboration in prior research. This project is relevant to the objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program which seeks to increase the level of cooperation between U.S. and Korean scientists and engineers through the exchange of scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.

The main objective of this interdisciplinary meeting is to bring together specialists from various fields such as engineering, physics, materials science, and mathematics and contrast their views on mechanical behavior with emphasis on plastic flow and fracture. Emphasis will be put on nonlinearity and pattern forming instabilities, as well as their implications into the understanding of the mechanical behavior of novel high-technological materials. The relevance of the notions of bifurcation, self organization, fractals, and chaos will critically be examined for the case of solids and the their microstructures. In this connection, the outstanding problem of the transition from microscales to macroscales will again be addressed.\n",

The principal investigator will investigate the Hecke algebras associated with Weyl groups in an effort to extend the work on q-Schur algebras and apply it to other groups of Lie type. This research is in the general area of the representation theory of finite classical groups. One of the main applications of group theory to other mathematical and scientific fields is in representation theory, and finite classical groups are a primary source of finite simple groups.\n",

This project will employ a newly developed Fabry-Perot interferometer which uses a bare-CCD detector to study the temperature and winds of the upper mesosphere and lower thermosphere. This in turn will be used to validate current global circulation models. This is a continuation of a program initiated in 1989 and promises to effectively contribute to our understanding of this atmospheric region and the modern techniques for studying this region.***\n",

      "a9002609 IBN $10000 An open International Conference on the Sodium Pump is planned for September 5-9, 1990, at the Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole, MA. It is the sixth in a series of triennial meetings, the third held in the U.S., and the first sponsored by the Society of General Physiologists. The pace of research on the sodium pump is accelerating. The conference will offer a timely opportunity for experts in these not (yet) overlapping fields to compare notes in an intensive five-day discussion, and to disseminate their conclusions to an audience much wider than the participants or the Society's membership, in particular, to colleagues working on other members of the E1-E2 transport ATPase family. Five major themes will be covered: (1) Molecular Biology of the Sodium Pump; (2) Structural Studies both empirical and theoretical; (3) Conformational Changes and Ion Occlusion; (4) Detailed steady-state and presteady-state (\"fast\") kinetics of the various pump modes; and (5) Electrogenicity and voltage dependence with emphasis on identifying the voltage sensitive step(s).

      "a9002613 PHY $90000 This award will provide funds to partially support a grant from the University of South Carolina to do research on heavy, weakly interacting massive particles (WIMP's) that might constitute the missing mass in the halo of our galaxy. For this, they will employ cryogenic detectors that respond to the increase in temperature caused by the energy deposition from nuclear recoil induced by collisions with the heavy particles. The first phase of the research will be the construction of an ultralow radioactive background liquid helium-4 cryostat and the development of a superconducting granular detector. The detector will consist of large arrays of superconducting sensors sensitive to the weakly interacting particles. These developments will provide the feasibility study of a new generation of detection techniques for weakly interacting particles in general, e.g. solar neutrinos. This project will be a collaborative effort between the University of South Carolina, the University of Maryland, the University of British Columbia and Applied Research Corporation.\n",
      "a9002614 CCR $128520 This research concerns fault-tolerant cellular automata (FTCA). Such automata require generally elaborate constructions. The notions introduced in previous years enable us to make the newer costructions much more transparent. All known FTCA rely heavily on the fact that the cells of the whole array update simultaneously. FTCA with asynchronous updation are being constructed. All known FTCA in dimensions lower than 3 must be prepared in an elaborate, hierarchical initial configuration. Techniques for building a FTCA without this requirement are being investigated. In this homogenous medium, arbitrarily complex noise-resistant structures arise spontaneously. The complexity is understood in the sense of carrying out complex computational tasks. The mathematical possibility of such a medium is significant for physics and biology as well as computer science. The computational and informational costs of all constructions are generally found to be near the theoretical minimum.\n",
      "a9002615 SES $28361 This award is supported through the Small Grants for Exploratory Research mechanism. This project documents the negotiated transition to democracy in Hungary. The researchers focus on the unprecedented negotiations in which the ruling communist party reached agreements with representatives of opposition parties and trade unions to establish the conditions for competitive political parties, contested elections, and parliamentary governance. These intensive roundtable negotiations, involving several hundred bargaining sessions (in plenary, committee, and subcommittee meetings), were conducted from June 13th to September 17th, 1989. A complete reconstruction of the negotiating process requires interviews with the main participants supplemented by reports from social scientists who observed the process. This project involves the use of existing tape recordings, minutes, and other summaries of various bargaining sessions, as well as in-depth interviews with those who participated in the process. All materials will be cataloged and archived for use by other social scientists interested in studying the transition to democracy in Hungary. The project should add considerably to our understanding of how a democratic political system with representative institutions and a vital public sphere is constructed.\n",

      "a9002641 DMS $53900 The principal investigator will study the geometry and manifold structure of Teichmuller space. He will focus his investigations on the infinite as well as finite dimensional cases. The project will have applications to three-dimensional topology, string theory, dynamical systems, and iteration of rational functions. A Teichmuller space consists of the set of all \"markings\" of a surface with a finite number of holes and a finite number of punctures. For example, a punctured inner tube has one hole and one puncture. A marking is a distinguished basis for the fundamental group of the surface. This might consist of several circles about the holes and punctures. The principal investigator will apply his theories of Teichmuller space to a variety of other applications within mathematics.\n",

One project is to develop new results on orbital integral formulas, symmetric spaces, and multiplicity questions in dynamical systems. The other project is a study of equivariant index theory, operator algebra invariants, and representations of discrete groups. This research is in the general subarea of modern analysis which examines the representation theory of algebras of functions.\n",
      "a9002643 ATM $37000 Solar wind plasma speed, the interplanetary magnetic field, the geomagnetic field, and the galactic cosmic ray intensity near the Earth all vary periodically in response to solar rotation. This study addresses specifically the problem of defining observationally the strength and period of recurrence in lists of impulsive events. The analysis strategy is to determine the frequency with which events are separated by a given time interval. Comparison of this frequency with that expected for events which occur randomly establishes the significance of the periodicities observed. Specifically, the analysis of interevent intervals in K-coronal data will compare the differential rotation of bright and dark coronal regions. With these coronal results, analysis of intervals between fast solar wind streams locates a mean latitude of origin for the solar stimulus for interplanetary recurrence. Impulsive geomagnetic disturbances as a proxy for interplanetary shocks, and their recurrence properties will be compared with similar analyses of recurrent cosmic ray variations. Longer term recurrence of geomagnetic disturbance will decide if there are terrestrial effects of the recently reported 150 day periodicity in solar flares.\n",
      "a9002644 AST $68000 Submillimeter Continuum Observations of Comets. Dr. Jewitt will make a detailed investigation of the submillimeter continua of comets, using primarily the 15 meter diameter James Clerk Maxwell Telescope on Mauna Kea in Hawaii. The submillimeter wavelength region of the cometary continuum is essentially unexplored. Only a small number of comets have yet been observed in the millimeter and submillimeter regions of the spectrum. The submillimeter continuum from comets is produced by thermal emission from the nucleus and from large grains in the coma. The large grains present a small fraction of the total cross section in cometary dust, but they may carry a large fraction of the total grain mass. Therefore, measurements of the large grains are of unique value in the study of the mass production rates of comets.\n",
      "a9002652 MCB $402944 Comparison of the amino acid sequences of plant vacuolar proteins indicates that there is no sequence in common among these proteins which can be solely responsible for targeting to vacuoles. Therefore, the study of sorting signals from different proteins will be required to understand the structural determinants involved in this process. Gramineae lectins, which are vacuolar proteins, are among the best characterized plant proteins. Amino acid sequences, 3-D protein structures, and cDNAs for these lectins are available. Transgenic tobacco plants and suspension cultures have been obtained which correctly express and process barley lectin. The goals of this research for the next five years include the analysis and characterization of protein sequences responsible for sorting to the vacuole and the identification of a putative receptor (or receptors) which recognizes these sorting sequences and subsequently mediates protein transport to vacuoles. The vacuolar sorting signal of the barley lectin proprotein will be identified and analyzed. Once the sorting signal is identified, the following questions will be addressed: 1) What is the shortest sequence capable of redirecting a reporter protein to the vacuole? 2) What are the specific amino acids within the sorting domain that are responsible for correct targeting? 3) Is secondary structure of the sorting signal important? The characteristics of binding of probarley lectin to its putative receptor(s) will also be determined. Maintenance of separate subcellular compartments in eukaryotic cells depends on the correct sorting and targeting of newly synthesized proteins. Thus, mechanisms must exist in the cell to assure that these proteins are targeted to the correct intracellular membranes. In plants, many proteins are deposited in multifunctional organelles called vacuoles. These proteins contribute to the lysosomal, storage, and plant defense functions of the vacuole. The goal of this research is to understand the mechanisms by which proteins are targeted to the plant cell vacuole. The results will contribute important new information on this important problem in plant cell biology.\n",
      "a9002656 AST $40400 This award supports a study to develop an optimal telescope design for a new all-sky survey at 2.2 micrometers. The major scientific goals of the survey are to study the large scale distribution of galaxies and the large scale distribution of stars within our Galaxy, without the interference of galactic dust obscuration. The survey would cover the entire sky at least twice, with sensitivity sufficient to detect point sources with K magnitude brighter than 14; the data would begin to become publicly available within 1 year after survey operations end. The baseline system calls for a special-purpose 1-m telescope and 256 X 256 array detectors. The enormous increase in sensitivity of the proposed survey compared to previous surveys makes its outcome broadly relevant to many disciplines. This study will lead to a preferred approach for a telescope design, as well as realistic estimate of the cost and schedule required to build it.\n",
      "a9002657 DMS $54400 Dr. Wright will be studying conditions which imply that certain contractible manifolds of dimensions greater than or equal to three cannot be non-trivial covering spaces. A very beautiful three-dimensional result of J. Robert Myers (Oklahoma State University) shows that genus one Whitehead manifolds cannot non-trivially cover any 3-manifold. Dr. Wright's objectives are to find conditions which can be easily checked which show that an open contractible n-manifold cannot be a covering space of any other manifold. These conditions will show that Whitehead manifolds (as defined by Myers) of arbitrary genus cannot be non- trivial covering spaces, that n-dimensional generalizations of the Whitehead manifolds cannot be non-trivial covering spaces, and that the interior of the Mazur contractible 4-manifold cannot be a non-trivial covering space. In fact, Dr. Wright expects his new approach to produce a significant understanding of which contractible open manifolds of all dimensions can be covering spaces.\n",
      "a9002659 IIS $137026 Formal representation of uncertainty is needed for taking account of partial knowledge, for dealing with uncertain data, for making decisions in uncertain circumstances. Probability theory provides the classical way of representing uncertainty, but numerous other representations have been proposed. These representations have a lot in common. This work will survey these proposals, with a view to exploring their relations. One approach which may serve to provide a general framework is the set-of-classical-distributions approach. Many representations of uncertainty can be construed as sets of distributions subject to a certain class of constraints. For example, Shafer's support functions can be seen as the infima of sets of distributions subject to the constraints of convexity and a special additivity constraint. This mechanism will be used to explore the relations among the various views. Finally, supposing that the constraints on the set of distributions come from general statistical knowledge in a database, this project will explore the problem of the feasible computation of uncertainties relative to such a database.\n",

      "a9002663 HRD $87614 Fossil ferns of the Dakota Group will be studied in morphological detail to determine their possible relationships. The material will be uncovered and macerated to extract the ferns, then the remains will be subjected to various types of treatment to prepare them for light, scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy. As much morphological information as possible will be obtained from these ferns. The localities will be recollected to obtain more material for possible bulk maceration and then sorted for any fragments of plant remains. Once the information has been collected for the ferns, they will be compared to closely related extant ferns and an analysis of characters using cladistic methods will be done. This analysis will aid in assessing possible relationships, primitive character states, and possible phylogenetic trees. Relating this study to previous studies of the ferns from the lower Cretaceous will make possible a hypothesis as to the changes in the fern flora throughout the Cretaceous and the potential impact of the angiosperms upon these fern floras. The interactive component involves a combination of activities as a professional researcher at the Florida State Museum and a professor in the Department of Botany. A seminar series cosponsored by the two groups will be used to bring women scientists in plant evolution to the university to present professional talks and to interact with the students and staff. Courses will be taught in the Department of Botany and interpretative programs aimed at school students will be offered at the Florida State Museum. This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering by providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers employed in industry, government, and academic institutions. By encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a valuable investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.\n",
      "a9002664 CCR $167943 High Speed Signal Processing is an important application of special purpose numerical processor designs. These digital processing systems involve interconnecting complex integrated circuits or a large self-contained VLSI design; both implementations contain dense electronic structures susceptible to internal temporary and permanent failures. Such systems are difficult to protect sufficiently by classical fault-tolerant computer design methods even though these systems also process numerical based data. This research examines new methods for introducing efficient fault- tolerant design methods in linear signal processing systems without degrading high speed performance. The approach is based on block and convolutional codes used in communication applications for error detection/correction in data sequences. Four specific research topics are addressed in this work. One topic involves the study of new design and modification options for real block and convolutional codes, while another examines the coverage for this type of algorithmic fault-tolerance. Practical CAD implementations are made to provide a basis for assessing overhead complexities. Software tools to aid designers in incorporating fault-tolerance easily within practical systems are also developed.\n",

      "a9002672 EAR $120000 The central Sierra Nevada batholith, an Andean-type magmatic arc, was emplaced in an overriding continental plate during the Cretaceous. Modern Andean studies imply the plate should be under compressional stress produced by subduction, however in the batholith only magmatic foliation is present and there is a virtual absence of regionally developed solid-state foliation. Given the compressional field thought to be active, these observations raise questions concerning the dynamic field attending emplacement of the batholith. This project will examine the geometry, kinematics and strain features of ductile shear zones in the batholith and wall rocks to establish their role in the dynamic and deformational history of batholith emplacement. Results are expected to shed light on upper crustal stress fields accompanying plutonism and in the fabrics developed in collisional tectonic environments.\n",

The investigator is primarily concerned with understanding how it is possible to jump between conjugacy classes without stabilization. This is one of the technical questions involved in understanding how a finite collection of (possibly knotted) simple closed curves in 3-dimensional space can be linked with one another.\n",

      "a9002675 AST $8000 This grant is for partial support of a conference on Variability of Active Galactic Nuclei, hosted by Georgia State University in Atlanta, from May 2 to May 4, 1990. One of the most rapidly evolving fields in astrophysics is that of Active Galactic Nu- clei. This is a field in which the high level of current re- search activity makes it very desirable to have a scientific conference on this topic on an annual basis. The last such conference in the United States was held at the University of California at Santa Cruz in August, 1988. It is anticipated that approximately 100 scientists actively engaged in research in this field will attend this conference.\n",
      "a9002677 ECS $161520 We propose to investigate enhancements of real-time Gas Electron Diffraction (GED) leading to application of this structure-analytic technique to the detection of effluents from Open Tubular Capillary Gas Chromatography (OTC-GC) columns. Our group was the first to successfully detect diffracted electrons by a phosphor screen coupled to a photodiode array. Our procedures are unique in the use of multichannel detection to obtain direct real- time structural information on molecules in the vapor phase. Later, we identified improvements in design that extend serviceability of GED to the study of analytes leaving the column of a gas chromatograph. GED affords a universal detector with relatively uniform sensitivity for diverse molecular species. The most singular feature is that it yields information on the structural makeup of those species. By combining the two techniques, GC and GED, we have pioneered a new area of structural chromatography. We now propose detector enhancements aimed at extending the applicability of this new method from the current nanoliter requirement of sample size to the picoliter domain, which would enable investigations with OTC- GC. This tool may find considerable importance, potentially as a standard instrument for analytical applications. In addition, the detector enhancements will pay secondary benefits in other ongoing experiments: in determining the structures of transient species and in kinetic studies with time resolution in the nanosecond regime using real-time electron diffraction with pulsed electron beams.\n",
      "a9002678 EAR $57700 This award provides one-half the funding for the acquisition of a computing system for the International Seismological Center (ISC). The ISC has committed the remaining half of the funds required. The International Seismological Center is the organization charged with the task of assembling final seismological observations, deriving definitive hypocentral solutions and magnitudes of earthquakes on a world-wide basis. The hypocenters and observations are archived on magnetic tape. The new computer system will be used to store readings, compute focal parameters and to prepare files of data on magnetic tape and in printed form for external users, including over 80 institutions in the U.S. The data are used as the basis for studies of earthquake mechanisms, earth structure and global seismicity.\n",
      "a9002679 DMS $39000 With this award the principal investigator will study models of nonlinear elasticity that describe the behavior of elastic materials at moderate to large deformations. In contrast to linear models nonlinear models usually require for their solution more sophisticated types of mathematical analysis. On the theoretical side the principal investigator will study the weak continuity of the Jacobian determinant and the choice of a space of admissible deformations. On the applied side he will study the stability of elastic composite materials such as foam rubber, and he will analyze solid-solid phase transitions in elastic crystals. A goodly number of everyday phenomena involving elastic materials can be explained using what is called linear elasticity theory. This linear theory concerns the behavior of elastic materials in response to small deformations. However when the deformations are moderate to large in size the linear theory must be replaced with a more complicated nonlinear theory. A nonlinear theory is also required if the material is a composite, such as foam rubber or fibre-reinforced rubber. With this award the principal investigator will use mathematical analysis to study models of nonlinear elastic materials.\n",
      "a9002684 ANI $34400 Weber State College will connect their campus network to WESTNET (a regional network which is part of the NSFNET). Direct connection to WESTNET will provide researchers with improved access to national networks such as CSNET/Bitnet and USENET. Improvement is sought in reliability, speed, turn-around, flexibility, and functions such as file transfer, remote login, and teleconferencing. The Weber State College connection to WESTNET will support and enhance currency and excellence in teaching and research by facilitating collaborative research, curriculum development, as well as communication among national committees on which faculty serve and chair. Access though WESTNET to bibliographic material and to computer systems not available on campus such as supercomputers will broaden the computing base for both faculty and students. This universal availablity will enhance students' preparation for courses and seminars and will especially impact students in science and engineering.***//\n",
      "a9002689 DEB $324292 The Florida Museum of Natural History is an active center for paleontological research and preservation of fossil collections. Under the stewardship of Dr. Douglas S. Jones, the invertebrate fossil collections have been the subject of renewed interest and significant support. This fossil collection now represents one of the fastest-growing repositories of invertebrate fossils in the country, and will soon become the premiere repository for marine invertebrates of Cenozoic age from the southeast U.S. and the Caribbean Ocean. Dr. Jones proposes transfer of the collection to high-density storage units, and acceleration of the efforts to arrange, catalog, and computerize the collection's holdings. The proposed curatorial improvement project will have wide- ranging benefits for the research community. Researchers will have improved access to the collections during their visits to Gainesville, and through a more effective program of borrowing specimens. The computer database will be a research resource in its own right, allowing investigators to explore patterns of fossil distribution through time and space. Natural history collections such as this are the primary documents of the evolution of life on earth. The research community realizes important dividends from their proper curation.\n",

      "a9002693 SES $28000 Working with Dr. Robert Nussbaum of the Dept. of Human Genomes Center at the University of Pennsylvania, Dr. Lindee is developing a research plan to understand modern eugenics. This plan includes a study of modern eugenics, 1950 to the present, which includes exploring the implications of the human genome project for future \"directed human evolution.\" She is trying to determine how concerns about human evolution have shaped the development of genetics. By the end of the postdoctoral year, significant progress should have been made on a scholarly study of the problem. As part of the training under Dr. Nussbaum, Dr. Lindee is working with research geneticists in an intense laboratory apprenticeship. She is also working with the Center staff in preparing for site visits, and will attend all administrative and scientific meetings of the Center. With the training and the research which she is undertaking under this fellowship, Dr. Lindee hopes to reshape the way historians, philosophers, and social scientists think about eugenics in America. Provocative recent work on German eugenics suggests some inadequacies of current American scholarship on this topic. This work hopefully will open the field to more productive analysis.\n",
      "a9002695 DMS $55600 Dr. Vilonen intends to continue his work on perverse sheaves, D-modules and their applications to representation theory. There are projects in three different areas. The first area of research is on problems relating to the micro-local structure of perverse sheaves, Riemann-Hilbert correspondence for irregular D-modules (and E-modules) and a direct construction of mixed perverse sheaves. The second area of research is on the Langlands conjecture. Here the investigator intends to work on a geometric form of the Langlands conjecture. This geometric formulation implies the Langlands conjecture for function fields. The third area of research is on representation theory of Lie groups. The goal here is to understand explicitly the structure of (g,K)-modules. These labors are all part of a large effort involving numerous mathematicians to perfect algebraic and analytic tools for relating geometry of spaces to properties of structures which \"live\" on these spaces.\n",
      "a9002697 CTS $310212 A combined numerical modeling and laboratory study will be conducted to simulate flow in ice covered rivers and channels. Velocity distributions, shear stresses, and macro turbulence features will be explored for flow under an ice cover and over an alluvial sediment bed and the dunes which are generated on such a bed. The computations will use a model which has recently been utilized in a study of turbulence over a wavy surface. The laboratory experiment will use an existing sediment flume with simulated ice. Improve accuracy in the prediction of flow rates, free surface height, and sediment transport under freezing conditions will have an important impact on environmental and structural issues related to the hydraulics of ice covered waters.\n",
      "a9002699 BCS $69571 Recent studies of international relationships among nations have focused on political aspects of interactions. This emphasis has produced a rich set of new insights, but it has not been complemented by an equally productive set of inquiries into the geographic dimensions of international conflict and cooperation. Essentially unanswered have been a number of crucial questions, such as How does the geographic context within which nations operate affect their relationships?, To what extent do spatial attributes within nations affect their relationships with other nations?, and How do the relative similarities and differences among nations affect bilateral relationships and the collective interactions of groups of nations within regions? This collaborative research project will address these and related questions by applying new methods of spatial analysis to a comprehensive database containing information about 120 nations between 1948 and 1988. Matrix-associative methods will be used to develop dynamic measures of state attributes, spatial heterogeneity, and spatial dependence; these measures will form the basis of a general model of post-World War II international behavior. The model will be validated through analysis of the development of regional alliances, identification of \"shatterbelt\" areas of high international tension, examination of different forms of economic interdependence, and investigation of regions of intense security-related activity. This project will benefit geographers, political scientists, and other scientists interested in the complex processes of international relationships in two ways. Conceptual understandings will be enhanced because the research will demonstrate the integral and complementary nature of spatial analysis as a means of investigating conflict and cooperation among nations. The project's empirical contribution will also be significant, because it will exhibit and expand the use of a rich new database. The implications of both types of contributions for persons directly involved in the development of international policies also will be significant.\n",
      "a9002700 BCS $6280 Inquiries into microclimatological patterns and processes have been inhibited by difficulties in determining micro-scale variations in heat and moisture transfers. Among the most important variables are transfers of water vapor through evaporation and transpiration from ground surfaces and vegetation into the air. Lysimeters have been developed to directly measure evapotranspiration, but these machines are large, stationary, expensive, and capable only of averaging readings over the area that they cover. This collaborative research project will refine and test a set of minilysimeters to measure spatial variations in the transfer of heat and moisture. Three continuously weighing, portable minilysimeters will be designed and tested in a carefully controlled experiment that will compare their measurements with records obtained using three alternative microclimatological approaches. This project will determine the extent to which small, portable minilysimeters can be used to accurately measure evapotranspiration in a variety of different sites. These tests will help ascertain the conditions in which these instruments will be useful and the confidence with which the data that they collect can be used. Because of the potential for using instruments of this type to provide heretofore unavailable information about micro-scale spatial variability in heat and moisture transfer, the project should contribute significantly toward advancement of microclimatological research.\n",
      "a9002701 DMS $174450 Three investigators will study problems interrelating the geometry and topology of finite dimensional manifolds with analytic, algebraic, and geometric properties of various function spaces that arise in the study of ordinary and partial differential equations on these manifolds. One investigator will study symmetry groups of a variational problem and the geometry of their associated sections and slices. The second will investigate the Grassmannian structures of the solution to integrable systems and the related Painleve analysis of these structures. And the third will analyze the relationship between the Laurent solutions to integrable systems and the geometry of their invariant tori. These three investigators will extend theories involving the geometry and algebra of certain integrable systems. One example of such systems are Hamiltonian differential equations which model the physical behavior of moving objects. These incorporate conservation of energy and momentum in an elegant manner. Solutions to these systems tend to circulate and don't have many of the properties of systems which incorporate friction.\n",

This approach is new and if successful, can be used to probe the properties of other receptor molecules.\n",
      "a9002703 CTS $30000 One of the most difficult areas of experimental heat transfer is that of determining the thermal response of solid surfaces placed inside the flow to highly non-steady fluctuations in temperature, pressure, velocity, etc. In recent years, very sophisticated computer codes have been developed which are capable of analyzing such flows, but typically, they involve some semi-empiricism. Experimental validation of these non- steady codes is therefore of great importance. However, the progress of experimental techniques has not kept pace with such computational developments, and much work is needed to provide such validation. One area where non-steady effects are of great importance is the area of turbo-machinery where high non-steadiness is produced by rotor-stator flow interactions, shock wave generation, turbulence, blade-boundary layer interaction, and the like. The Axial Flow Turbine Facility at Penn State with its instrumentation in the rotor frame of reference is uniquely equipped to attempt such validation. The innovation of the proposed research is to attempt to simulate non-steady heat transfer in a turbo-machine by introducing a slug of high temperature air flow at a relatively small segment of the periphery of the turbo- machine, over a very small increment of time. If the simulation proves valid, then the experimental study of non-steady transfer characteristics in turbo-machines will be greatly simplified, and lead to relatively rapid progress in this important field. In addition, fundamental information on non-steady heat transfer will emerge from this study.\n",

      "a9002728 EAR $38710 The research program proposed here is based on the identification of a stable reference frame for measurement, and its utilization in the construction of a calibrated eustatic sea level curve for mid-Jurassic through mid-Tertiary. A stable frame is found in the Russian Platform on which flat-lying Mesozoic and Cenozoic marine sediments have remained undeformed since deposition. The elevation of these deposits is a measure of post-depositional sea level change, since factors such as compaction and loading are very small due to the thin nature of the deposits. As such, the Russian Platform acts as a meter stick, recording sea level through time. A sea level curve based on reliable tie points will be constructed and compared to sea level curves obtained by other means. Discrepancies will be reconciled in terms of measurement methods and mobile reference frames. In obtaining independent information regarding past sea levels, the results of this study will shed light on the passive margin processes of thermal subsidence and sedimentation, as well as the motions of active margins. As it stands now, sequence stratigraphic data must be used to infer thermal subsidence and sedimentation history, as well as sea level changes. A significant result of the proposed research project is that it will introduce another data set, so that the sea level signal can be filtered out, and sequence stratigraphic data can be used to measure thermal subsidence and sedimentation history directly. Research bears on issues of global sea level change.\n",
      "a9002729 MCB $49640 Dr. Reeve has recently gained access, through a NATO sponsored collaboration with Professor K. O. Stetter in Germany, to an archaebacterium that is hyperthermophilic (grows only within the temperature range of 90 to 115 degrees Centigrade). These bacteria grow at the highest temperatures known for a living organism, and it is impossible to carry out genetic approaches to understanding how the bacterium can grow at these temperatures using current genetic techniques. Genes from the hyperthermophile AV19 will be cloned into Escherichia coli, where it may be possible to determine their function and DNA sequences. If preliminary experiments are successful under this Small Grant for Exploratory Research they will open up a major field of study that would be more appropriate for a larger award.\n",

His general interest ranges over all aspects of the theory, from the basic foundations and representation theorems, via specific properties of exchangeable processes, to a variety of applications and extension to other areas of probability theory. The present proposal is focused on some specific problems involving multivariate representation theorems and their relation to multiple stochastic integration, the notion of spreadability or subsequence invariance, the representation of stable stochastic integrals and properties of exchangeable interval partitions, their local time random measures and Palm distributions.\n",
      "a9002733 DMS $214900 Three investigators will study problems in Kaehler geometry, calibrations, spinors, and Teichmuller theory. These involve Chern currents, slicing, spin structures, harmonic maps between Teichmuller spaces, the Thurston boundary of Teichmuller space, and moduli spaces of compact Riemannian surfaces. Differential geometry is the study of the structure and shape of generalized surfaces. These investigators will concentrate their efforts on surfaces based on the complex numbers rather than the real numbers. A Teichmuller space is the reduction of one of these complex generalized surfaces to a system of lower dimensional objects which are easier to understand. These investigators will continue their studies of such spaces in an effort to apply these new theories to questions arising from particle physics.\n",
      "a9002736 DMS $61524 Professor Wermer plans to generalize his work with H. Alexander on the polynomial hull of a convex set in complex n- dimensional space lying over the unit circle. Natural generalizations occur when the circle is replaced by the unit sphere in complex 2-space or by the boundary of a multiply connected domain. The area of application of these ideas is the theory of analytic functions of several complex variables. An analytic function is one which is differentiable in the sense of elementary calculus but where the variable is a complex number. The imposition of the requirement of differentiability leads to a large but remarkable class of functions whose properties are still poorly understood in higher dimensions. Professor Wermer will investigate some of these properties.\n",
      "a9002744 DMS $219700 This award supports the research in arithmetic algebraic geometry of Professor Gerd Faltings of Princeton University. Dr. Faltings's research will be centered on questions about p-adic analysis and Diophantine geometry. He has recently discovered p- adic symmetric domains, and plans to study their cohomology and construct their Satake compactifications. In Diophantine geometry, he plans to use new methods, in particular the Product Theorem that he has recently proved, to reformulate the classical theory of Diophantine approximations. This is research in the field of arithmetic algebraic geometry, a subject that combines the techniques of algebraic geometry and number theory. In its original formulation, algebraic geometry treated figures that could be defined in the plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Number theory started with the whole numbers and such questions as divisibility of one whole number by another. These two subjects, seemingly so far apart, have in fact influenced each other from the earliest times, but in the past quarter century the mutual influence has increased greatly. The field of arithmetic algebraic geometry now uses techniques from all of modern mathematics, and is having corresponding influence beyond its own borders.\n",
      "a9002745 DMS $180000 In this proposal the principal investigator plans to continue his studies of the formation and propagation of shock waves in stiff polymeric materials and to develop a mathematical theory of finite deformations of membranes. The latter theory is useful in providing better estimates of the errors incurred when employing stress analysis to wrinkled membranes. The principal investigator will also study the mathematical properties of certain idealized materials that have applications to the twinning of crystals and the behavior of shape-memory alloys. Materials scientists very often study the properties of materials by testing their responses to applied stresses; one could call this the experimental approach. Mathematicians interested in the behavior of materials usually take a different approach which involves the theoretical analysis of mathematical models of materials. In this proposal the principal investigator will use advanced mathematics to try to understand twinning in crystals, necking in polymers and the behavior of shape-memory alloys.\n",
      "a9002748 CHE $48138 In this SGER grant in the Theoretical and Computational Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Adamowicz will develop new techniques dealing with the detailed interactions among the motions of electrons and nuclei in atoms and molecules. The new techniques will then be applied to obtain an understanding of highly energetic species. The PI will develop a new approach to treating the Born-Oppenheimer breakdown, using a non-adiabatic basis set and a variational functional for the total energy of the system. Instead of a rigorous separation of the internal and external motions, the new method is based on forcing the system to stop its translation in space and assume the desired rotational state by introducing penalty operators into the variational functional.\n",
      "a9002754 CMS $50000 This project focuses on the Loma Prieta earthquake. The Institute for Social Science Research (ISSR) and the School of Public Health at the University of California, Los Angeles, with consultative assistance from the southern California Earthquake Preparedness Project (SCEPP), will collect perishable data from a representative sample of 375 respondents in the San Francisco Bay Area. The data will be collected by telephone interview. Using an instrument designed for the collection of data from Los Angeles following the Whittier Narrows earthquake of October 1, 1987, the data collected will assess community members' experiences during and after, and reactions to, the Loma Prieta earthquake of October 17, 1989. Creation of this unique data set will allow for the comparison of community members in the two most earthquake-prone urban areas of the United States.\n",
      "a9002764 PHY $1650000 This award will provide support to a group from Johns Hopkins University, who is participating in an experiment in high energy physics with the L3 detector at LEP, CERN Switzerland, the new 27 kilometer electron positron collider. The aim of the experiment is the study of the properties of the Zo particle, the neutral carrier of the weak nuclear force, involving the decay of Zo into hadrons, and a precise determination of the number of neutrino species. It will also search for new particles. The primary focus of the L3 detector is its ability to achieve mass measurements to better than 1% for the leptons. An important part of the muon detection system is the Time Expansion Chamber (TEC) a device with strict resolution requirements. The Johns Hopkins group is responsible of the readout and software of the calibration system of TEC, which is to provide 0.1% calibration for the drift velocity during normal data taking runs, an essential feature for some of the physics to be achieved by the L3 detector.\n",
      "a9002767 CCR $157005 This project is a study of several fundamental issues arising in the problem of multiuser optical communications. Two general topics are being addressed: (1) the stochastic modelling of the spectral behavior of semiconductor lasers and a corresponding assesment of the fundamental effects of phase instabilities on multiuser optical systems; and (2) the optimum demodulation of multiple access optical signals within both continuous and quantum observation models.\n",
      "a9002768 DMS $43500 The principal investigator will continue his research into the numerical solution of the acoustic equations that govern the generation and propagation of noise by aircraft. Specifically he will study two major problem areas: the development and implementation of numerical codes that can resolve the acoustic equations in the presence of vorticity, and the posing of physically correct and numerically consistent boundary conditions for flow problems in unbounded domains. The vorticity that is generated near sharp edges like the engines or the landing gear creates difficulties for conventional numerical codes, and so the principal investigator is developing a finite element code that obviates many of the problems associated with vorticity. With regard to the posing of proper boundary conditions it is necessary to set boundary conditions on an artificial interface, in order to make the computations for a problem in an infinite domain tractable. The problem of aircraft noise during landings and takeoffs is of growing concern to many communities and local governments. One obvious solution of this problem is to design airplanes whose engines and exterior surfaces operate at minimal noise levels. As one can imagine easily this is a complicated phenomenon, and so mathematicians and aerodynamicists often resort to modelling the complex sets of equations with simpler ones, and then solving the approximate equations numerically. However this can be tricky too, since aircraft generate vorticity, which influences the noise pattern and which often defeats conventional numerical schemes. The principal investigator is working on numerical algorithms that can handle the vorticity and the unboundedness of the flow domain in a computationally efficient manner.\n",
      "a9002769 DMS $166200 This research is concerned with noncommutative algebra, particularly the theory of noncommutative noetherian rings and its applications to other areas of mathematics. The principal investigator will study the abstract properties of nontrivial examples and their interrelationship with the theory of quantum groups. He will also consider the skew group ring of a finite group acting on a polynomial ring to determine when the category of projective modules over such a ring satisfies cancellation. The postdoctoral associate will study the stable rank of enveloping algebras of semisimple Lie algebras. A ring is an algebraic object having both an addition and a multiplication defined on it. Although the additive operation satisfies the commutative law, the multiplicative operation is not required to do so. The study of noncommutative rings has become an important part of algebra because of its increasing significance to other branches of mathematics and physics.\n",
      "a9002771 DMS $189900 Two investigators will continue their studies of global problems in differential geometry and related areas. One will investigate the Gromov-Hausdorff closure of the class of Riemannian manifolds with curvature bounded from below and diameter from above. In this setting, structure problems, finiteness problems, and uniqueness problems will be investigated in terms of volume and new metric invariants such as excess and triameter. The second postdoctoral investigator will study the relationship between geometry and topology of certain classes of manifolds. Finiteness, Riemannian fibrations, injectivity radius, and rigidity will be among the aspects of these spaces to be investigated. For many years geometers have worked to understand the relationship between the curvature of generalized surfaces and their shape. These investigators have proven that such surfaces which have curvature bounded below and diameter bounded above, must have certain specified shapes. In this project they will expand this investigation to include surfaces with other desireable properties.\n",
      "a9002777 ECS $8000 This is a block travel grant to partially support persons attending the Fourth International Symposium on Harmonics in Power Systems in October, 1990 in Budapest, Hungary. The meeting is an IEEE co-sponsored meeting which has been held in the past in the United States and Canada. This is an international meeting which typically attracts many Europeans. This grant will enhance the representation of U.S. power engineers at this meeting.\n",
      "a9002779 DMS $15600 The existence and classification of finite groups of symmetries of manifolds of dimensions three and four will be studied. Recently there has been a tremendous growth in our understanding of low-dimensional manifolds, based on techniques pioneered by W. Thurston, M. Freedman, and S. Donaldson. These new techniques and results have provided the tools to investigate much more systematically the symmetries of these manifolds and to sharpen significantly the questions that one can hope to address. Existence of symmetries of 4-manifolds: Freedman showed how to classify all simply connected, closed topological 4-manifolds in terms of their intersection forms and stable triangulation obstructions. It is then appropriate to ask what symmetries these manifolds admit. Results of the Principal Investigator show that all these 4-manifolds admit locally linear Zn actions for all odd n and that all except possibly the fake complex projective plane admit Z actions that are not necessarily locally linear. All the actions above were constructed so as to be homologically trivial, inducing the identity on homology. One is led to ask: What automorphisms of the intersection form of a closed simply connected topological 4-manifold can be realized by a periodic homeomorphism of the manifold?\n",
      "a9002786 CCR $174618 In many programming languages, especially those with a \"functional\" style of programming, the vast majority of objects are not modified after they are created. The ML language is unusual in that the compile-time typechecker can distinguish in advance objects that may be modified from objects that may not. This advance information about immutability can be used by implementations in several ways: by optimizing compilers, where it simplifies aliasing calculations; by garbage collectors, where it can improve locality of reference; by parallelizing compilers, where it simplifies sharing of data; and by debuggers, where it allows efficient replay of program execution. Since ML is one of the few imperative languages that provides compile-time guarantees of immutability, there has not been much research into the uses of immutability. There are many ways that compile-time guarantees can be translated into run-time savings; several of these will be studied.\n",
      "a9002789 HRD $125000 The long-term goals of this research is to advance the theory of nonlinear 0-1 programming, to design efficient algorithms for the main type of such problems arising in engineering and to make largely available the corresponding codes. Further investigations will be undertaken towards the improvement of exact and heuristic solution methods for unconstrained, constrained and hyperbolic nonlinear 0-1 programs, and their application to reasoning under uncertainty in expert systems (probabilistic logic) and to machine load balancing problems in flexible manufacturing. Interactive activities include teaching preceptorial courses on Case Studies in Operations Research and on Integer Programming and giving guest lectures. Additionally, Dr. Jaumard will lead seminars on recent research problems. This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering by providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers employed in industry, government, and academic institutions. By encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a valuable investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.\n",
      "a9002791 DMS $110759 Stochastic approximation techniques will be applied to develop computational algorithms for the statistical analysis of spatial processes and for the control of laboratory instruments. Both the practical implementation and theoretical properties of the algorithms will be investigated. New methods for locating variable-stabilizing transformations will be studied. These methods will be based on a nonparametric estimate of the variance function. These new techniques are promising for multivariate transformation families such as the shifted-power transformations and nonparametric spline transformations. Transformations will also be investigated in the context of density estimation. The method to be investigated consists of transforming the data to a density that can be accurately estimated by a kernel estimator, applying a kernel estimator, and transforming this estimate back to the original space to estimate the density of the original data. Source appointment is a methodology for attributing pollution to its sources by chemical mass balance. Source apportionment when the composition of one source is unknown will be investigated. Nonlinear regression will be studied when there are measurement errors in the independent variables and no replication.\n",
      "a9002794 DMS $14582 Work on this project will focus on problems arising in the theory of orthogonal polynomials. These are polynomials in one complex variable which are orthogonal with respect to some density (measure) defined on the complex plane. Particular emphasis will be placed on those measures which are supported on bounded sets. The setting is more general than the study of polynomials defined on a circle. It is motivated by studies of the Schrodinger equation and dynamical problems which have led to polynomials orthogonal on Julia sets and on spectral questions concerning Jacobi matrices with unbounded or periodic entries which are orthogonal on several intervals. The latter questions emerging from statistical physics. Two primary goals in the work involve the location of the roots of orthogonal polynomials and analyzing certain asymptotic relationships involving successive roots of polynomials as their degrees increase. The method to be employed involves a potential theoretic approach by which asymptotics are measured by the Green's function for the support set. Other work will involve Pade approximation and weighted polynomial approximation in Lebesgue spaces defined on plane regions.\n",
      "a9002797 CCR $127157 Computer memory is structured in layers, for example (moving from inner to outer registers, \"main\" memory/RAM, and disk. Each is slower but larger than those within it. These layers are reflected in the design of conventional programming languages (respectively, by local variables, non-local variable and arrays, and files), and programs are designed to take best advantage of their relative speed, size, and persistency. Functional or applicative programming languages are most promising for parallel processing, but they do not yet deal with this layering of memory. Rather, present practice there is to treat all memory as RAM, structured as a \"heap\" for linked data structures, even though this unilevel model restricts their utility. Furthermore, although linked structures are very attractive for partitioning problems among processors, parallel heap management is an open problem. This project explores methods of reconciling the necessary layering of physical memory into the practice of purely functional programming. One goal is to demonstrate performance of reference-counting memory (RCM) hardware, which can manage a heap shared by many processors. Reckoning at the memory address--remotely from any processor--it recovers most unused memory without any processor synchronization and little additional communication. Another goal is to implement a persistent file system within a purely functional language. Persistency requires that files survive certain unpredictable failures. Therefore, the system must retain current state of the files, even though the concept of state is forbidden in functional programming.\n",
      "a9002798 DMS $33500 Haught will continue her investigation of the degree structures induced by strengthenings of Turing computability. These strengthenings are obtained by placing size restrictions on various aspects of a Turing calculation. In particular, she is interested in truth table reducibility, weak truth table reducibility, and polynomial-time bounded Turing reducibility. She plans to develop technical methods for solving structural questions about the degrees, and to analyze the degree structures in terms of the proof techniques which are appropriate to the structures. In this way she hopes to uncover heretofore hidden connections among the various degree structures. Other aspects of the project are a continuation of Haught's study of the interactions between model theory and recursion theory in the setting of reverse mathematics, and an investigation of the properties of introreducible sets, but the major effort will be invested in understanding what it means for a proposition to be unprovable, making use of the various idealizations of computability cited above.\n",
      "a9002803 DMS $85434 The investigators will continue development of new analytic approaches to homoclinic and heteroclinic bifurcation in several important areas of applied dynamical systems. In particular, they will continue development of a new bifurcation function approach to periodic and aperiodic solutions near homoclinic orbits and heteroclinic cycles. They will to continue development of a unified theory of interior layers of singular perturbation problems using heteroclinic bifurcation techniques and a version of the shadowing lemma. They will continue working with shock wave solutions of nonstrictly hyperbolic PDE's and PDE's that change type using heteroclinic bifurcation techniques. They will extend a new rigorous algorithm for numerical continuation of homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits to include continuation to the point where an equilibrium becomes nonhyperbolic. Finally, they will investigate nonhomogeneous solutions of reaction-diffusion equations near spatially homogeneous solutions represented by homoclinic orbits or heteroclinic cycles of an ODE.\n",

      "a9002808 ATM $312503 The evaluation of climate models is a very important research goal for the atmospheric sciences. One approach to evaluate climate models is to check their sensitivity to altered boundary conditions and their ability to reproduce past environments on the earth. This proposal requests support to continue research on modeling and analysis of past climate by focussing on the sensitivity of the climate system to variations in the seasonal cycle, primarily for intervals in earth history when a supercontinent dominated the surface of the earth. The research will utilize a hierarchy of simple and complex models (EBM and GCM). This research is important because it will help to evaluate the past environmental conditions on earth and to understand the dynamics of the climate system.\n",
      "a9002813 IBN $2000 This proposal requests funds to help provide support for student participants at the 1990 Northeast Regional Conference on Developmental Biology. This Conference will be held at the Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole, Massachusetts, April 20-22, 1990. The Conference will include four platform sessions, two poster sessions, a keynote address and ample opportunity for informal discussion of research. There are two general goals of this Regional Meeting in bringing together younger investigators in the field of developmental biology. The first is to expose them to important current research in laboratories throughout the Northeast. The second is to give them a chance to present their own work in both formal presentation as well as informal discussions. The specific goal of this 1990 meeting is to bring together those investigators working on plant development and those working on animal development in order to develop a common language and appreciation of each other's work.\n",

      "a9002819 CCR $270404 The research is largely motivated by complexity considerations. To understand complexity of algorithms, it is often necessary to obtain good lower and upper bounds to commutative algebra. In the last few years, new bounds have been achieved in three key areas: namely, Groebner Bases, Hilbert Nullstellensatz and Wu-Ritt Characteristic Sets. The proof techniques employed are novel and contain ideas that have much wider potential applications. These and a few other related techniques will be further investigated and new algorithms based on these ideas will be devised. Another area is the construction of efficient algorithms -- for GCD. Sturm sequences, computations with algebraic numbers. Groebner bases and Wu-Ritt characteristic sets. Here also some important progress has been achieved. Further applications of these results to obtain decomposition of ideals and varieties, and extensions to more general classes of algebraic structures will be pursued. An important area that has not received much attention is the one dealing with the choice of data structures in algebraic algorithms . This seems a very exciting area because the computational objects (multivariate polynomials, ideals) here are much richer in structure than anything that has been traditionally studied in data structures. Research will be undertaken in this area to address issues of the following kind: Selection of data structures for various computational algebraic algorithms, Application of amortization and hashing techniques to algebraic data structures, etc.\n",
      "a9002820 CMS $89300 The test results of a bridge will be used to calibrate standards for strength evaluation of existing bridges. Nondestructive test procedures for bridge condition evaluation being researched by the University of Cincinnati will also be calibrated. It is proposed to further exploit this test for the advancement of analytical modeling and nonlinear analysis of reinforced concrete structures. Collaborating researchers from the University of Cincinnati and Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates will design, conduct and document the test as a benchmark experiment for validating and calibrating RC bridge analytical finite-element modeling and analysis. Instrumentation will be designed and installed to measure local and global responses to serve this purpose. Information will be documented, archived and disseminated to permit analytical model generation and response simulation by analytical researchers.\n",
      "a9002822 CCR $100984 Nuprl is a system supporting the interactive development of formal mathematics. It was designed to be especially suited to computationally significant mathematics and to the construction of formally verified software. The implementation of Nuprl, funded by the NSF, was completed in 1984. Since then the system has been used extensively at Cornell and elsewhere as a basis for further research. This research has resulted in significant advances in the areas of automated reasoning and computational logic. The system has been successfully applied to a wide range of problems, from verification of computer hardware to an open problem in the theory of programming languages. It has been the subject of many articles and PhD theses. The goal of the present project is to rewrite parts of the system in order to incorporate certain extensions (a reflection mechanism) and improvements (new definition facility). These are based on several years of study and experience with the system. They will make the system more accessible, both to researchers in the area and to others such as mathematicians and educators. With the implementation of the reflection mechanism, Nuprl will be applicable to domains that are currently difficult to treat.\n",
      "a9002826 CCR $80190 Nets are widely used in the theory of concurrency. One evident reason for that is the convenience of visualizing the communication structure of systems. Nets seem to cover almost any situation which involves \"sharing\" or communication. For an engineer it could mean sharing of component terminals by connecting them electrically; a mathematician can consider sharing of variables in a system of equations or sharing relations when they are composed. This is a research program into semantics of concurrent systems which are based on the net concept. Hopefully the expected results will provide a reliable basis for design of such systems and reasoning about them. As a byproduct one can expect also more insight into the semantics of nets in other \"sharing situations\". Fundamental research will be carried out on semantics and proof theory of networks of dataflow and other concurrent processes, emphasizing \"causal\" semantics to support refinement and atomicity of process behavior. The work will be carried out by Professor Boris A. Trakhtenbrot of Tel Aviv University in collaboration with the Principal Investigator.\n",

This conference on the physical and mathematical basis for the various modelling efforts underway is very timely. By inviting atmospheric scientists to describe and review the methods used in their already successful modelling efforts, the conference has the potential of simulating rapid progress in the task of unifying fast microscale phenomena with slower macroscale phenomena in computational models of geospace. This conference will provide an excellent forum for informal exchange between space and atmosphere physicists that will enhance greatly our understanding of the issues and processes involved. ***//\n",
      "a9002835 ATM $158569 Solutions to the atmospheric (or oceanic) prediction equations require an understanding of the three dimensional spatial nature of the fluid, including dynamics and physics, conservation conditions, and forcing. Since the equations are exceptionally complex and highly nonlinear, it is necessary to convert those equations to some numerical form which will provide meaningful iterative solutions within the constraints of available computational capabilities. The challenge is to do so optimally. While the problem has been investigated, because of the nature of the system, horizontal and vertical representations have been considered independently in the past. It is the contention of the principal investigator that systematic truncation of the atmosphere/ocean prediction equations in all three dimensions simultaneously could improve predictive skill. Thus, the purpose of this research is to study the correlation of truncation in all dimensions in a numerical model, and to find a truncation which is systematic in all three dimensions. The principal investigator will select a truncation according to scaling arguments that are based on the results from his previous studies and define appropriate functions. To establish the optimal three dimensional truncation, the functions will be tested in the operational numerical prediction model of NOAA's National Meteorological Center (NMC). This project is part of the NSF-NMC Program Joint Program in Numerical Weather Prediction.\n",
      "a9002837 DMS $15585 The principal investigator will show how the inverse problem in underwater acoustics can be solved for the case of finite oceans with a depth-varying index of refraction. There are two difficulties. The first involves the interaction of th\u001a ocean and the bottom. The second involves the fact that the index of refraction of the water varies with depth. The problem with the ocean bottom can be taken care of by postulating an appropriate far-field boundary condition, while the problem with the variable refractivity is solved by replacing the original set of equations with a set of averaged equations that are more tractable. The analytical work will be complemented with numerical simulations. One reason that people are interested in underwater acoustics is that it is important to be able to locate and track submarines using a satellite. Essentially a satellite sends a signal to a part of the ocean to look for a submarine and interprets the return signal. This is a difficult problem because the ocean is a complicated medium and the return signal can be distorted easily. The principal investigator will study ways of improving the interpretation of signals from the ocean by using mathematical analysis and numerical simulations.\n",
      "a9002839 BCS $36000 Numerous rock shelters or overhangs which line the base of Cingles del Capello, a cliff located in SE Barcelona Province, Spain, have been shown to contain stratified archaeological deposits. These are of interest for several reasons. First, they contain stratified materials which document the Neanderthal period in Europe and which probably continue into more recent times. Second, because sedimentation in this region appears to be rapid, clean separation between different occupations of these rockshelters is likely. Finally, the shelters contain layers of travertine the age of which can be determined by Uranium series dating. For these reasons Dr. Lawrence Straus will conduct a season of archaeological excavation at two cliff sites: Cova Anton and Els Pinyons. He will clean the face of previously excavated pits, remove overburden, and then conduct careful stratigraphic excavation to determine the nature of the cultural materials present. He will collect and analyze faunal and floral materials as well as lithic remains. In addition to travertines, organic materials will be submitted for absolute age determinations. Anatomically modern humans first appeared in Europe approximately 35,000 to 40,000 years ago. Before that time the human inhabitants were physically distinct and termed \"Neanderthals.\" The associated culture is called \"Mousterian.\" It is unclear what happened to the Neanderthals and not known whether they developed relatively rapidly into modern forms or whether they were replaced by other peoples. It is also unclear whether or not the succeeding \"Upper Paleolithic\" cultural tradition developed directly from the Mousterian or is intrusive from elsewhere. Because sites which are both datable and which cover this time period are so rare, it has been difficult to select between alternatives, and in this context El Pinyons and Cova Anton assume great significance. This research is important because it will shed light on the emergence of anatomically modern humans and associated culture in Europe.\n",

The workshop will involve up to five representatives from the different Bolivarian countries (Panama, Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia) plus Chile, with an emphasis on the selection of young and active mathematicians interested in increasing communication with the international mathematical community. In addition, there will be participation of a number of outstanding European mathematicians who will be supported by their own countries. The workshop will include the following activities: lectures, round table discussions, and a mini-course with ample opportunities for informal discussions. The teaching of mathematics and the promotion of research activities will be emphasized, taking into account the experiences of the attendees. The participation of a distinguished group of U.S. mathematicians, who are knowledgeable about the problems of doing research and teaching in Latin America, is likely to lead to improved communication and increased mathematical activity in the region.\n",
      "a9002843 OCE $69878 Transoceanic undersea telecommunications cables are becoming available for re-use by the scientific community. These cables cross vast regions of the floors of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. They traverse nearly every type of geomorphic province, including deep ocean basins, ridge systems, oceanic trenches and continental margins; and they underlie most features of ocean dynamics including western and eastern boundary currents, central gyres and areas of fronts and eddies. The workshop will 1) assess scientific needs, opportunities and interest for re-use of cables soon to be abandoned by international telephone companies, 2) develop initial technical models for adding scientific instrumentation, 3) examine ways to manage facilities, experiments and data, and 4) determine cost estimates for scientific use of these systems. The workshop is being held in January 1990 on Oahu in Hawaii where primary shore-based cable facilities for the Pacific are located. The University of Hawaii will provide local support. A seven member science steering committee will ensure balanced representation of the approximately 30 participants anticipated. They will also prepare and publish a full report of the workshop, with conclusions, working papers and recommendations for science planning included, by mid-1990.\n",
      "a9002844 DMI $225000 Catalytically stabilized thermal (CST) incineration of chlorinated hydrocarbons uses catalytic surface reactions to stabilize gas phase reactions. Hot wall effects and surface- generated reactive intermediates are hypothesized to improve stabilization of gas phase chlorinated hydrocarbon combustion, enabling rapid plug flow (low residence time and small combustor size) incineration with high destruction of toxic organic species, and stable combustion of even very low BTU mixtures. Work to date has shown that a CST incinerator can stabilize methyl chloride and methylene chloride combustion sufficiently to enable high throughput plug flow operation, achieving 99.999% + destruction levels with a residence time of 15 ms. In Phase I, reaction mechanisms for methyl chloride destruction in plug flow thermally stabilized and catalytically stabilized reactors were investigated, through preliminary model development and through experimental flow tube kinetic studies. This work identified preliminary parameters and provided a initial basis for further experimental studies and development of a catalytic plug flow reactor model in Phase II, for use in Phase III prototype development and system design. First approximation plug flow thermal reactor model results predicted high destruction levels at moderately high temperature, and this was confirmed experimentally in a non-catalytic isothermal reactor. Catalytic isothermal reactor experiments altered the gas phase reaction mechanisms and significantly lowered required temperature and residence time for high destruction. The experimental findings advance fundamental understanding of the underlying mechanisms affecting chlorinated hydrocarbon combustion and emissions. Ultra-high destruction effectiveness, increased safety, small incinerator size and reduced costs will make this technology attractive to the large and growing thermal incineration market.\n",

The project is in the general area of statistics and probability. Errors-in-variables regression models describe relationships among variables when both the explanatory and response variables are subject to random error. Emphasis in this research will be placed on the role of reliability of measurements in determining the performance of errors-in-variables regression techniques. Goodness of fit procedures assess the adequacy of distributional assumptions or of structural models. This research will involve a study of general multinomial-based procedures for testing fit in categorical data.\n",
      "a9002848 DMS $83909 This project will develop analytical and numerical studies directed at hybrid computational schemes that use Lagrangian augmentation technology to treat problems with intricate constraints implicitly, and gradient projection methods to handle simpler constraints explicitly. These studies are motivated by questions in optimal control where there is the need to solve large systems of equations subject to contraints with special mathematical structures. Optimal control problems arise naturally in engineering and natural sciences.\n",
      "a9002850 DMS $26179 This work addresses wave propagation in extended, inhomogeneous, multidimensional environments capable of channeling energy over many wavelengths. Sound propagation in the ocean and electromagnetic guided-wave propagation are two examples. The objective of this research is to further develop and apply \"microscopic\" phase space (pseudo-differential and generalized Fourier integral operator) methods and global path integral constructions to derive new multidimensional algorithms for forward acoustic propagation and generalized acoustic tomography at the level of the n-dimensional scalar Helmholtz equation.\n",
      "a9002852 DMS $48024 Work on this project combines investigations into mathematical questions of classical complex analysis with applications to control problems and finitely generated algebras of functions of several complex variables. The optimal control problems, arising in engineering, are phrased in terms of vector-valued, bounded, functions defined on certain cylinder-like sets. One is interested in minimizing a certain functional over the class of functions. Sometimes there are no extermal functions, other times they turn out to be analytic. Sometimes there are unique solutions, but not always. The goal of this work is to describe the cylinders which give rise to bounded analytic optimal functions which are smooth on the boundary of the cylinder. A number of positive results in this area have focused the problem to one of taking analytic selections of functions on sets fibered over the unit circle and determining when such functions agree with a given function when restricted to the unit interval. Work on algebra generators evolves from an earlier result of Gleason which suggests that the classes of continuous and holomorphic functions in the two-dimensional domains which vanish at the origin are finitely generated algebras. This is easy to do for the bidisc, although the minimum norm of the generators is not yet known (it is probably unity). This particular question is to be addressed by computational methods first to verify the conjectured minimum. For the general Gleason problem, a new approach will be made by converting it to an equivalent problem in first order partial differential equations. Estimates for the norm of the generators should follow if this plan works out.\n",
      "a9002856 DMS $87354 A series of topics in probability and statistics will be studied which are unified by the geometric techniques that are employed. Contact sets will be used to study questions of robustness in Bayesian estimation. The question of reconstructing a subset from finitely many central projections, knowing that it comes from a given population, will be examined. The results will be applied to problems in tomography. A further goal is a better understanding of the structure of finite dimensional moment spaces induced by the class of all measures on a given polyhedral region. Further aims are generalized confidence intervals subject to a preassigned smoothness condition and probability densities having given moments and possessing a maximal degree of smoothness. A new minimal entropy method will be studied to achieve a partition of data into relatively homogeneous blocks or clusters.\n",
      "a9002857 DMR $240000 The goal is to examine dynamics and phase transitions for adsorbates at high densities and low temperatures, and under restricted dimensionality, using pulsed NMR as a probe. The proposed research includes: studies of structure, motions, conversion and phase-transitions in solid H2, HD and D2 at high densities; high-pressure studies of Kr and Xe; very detailed studies of adsorbed films of H2, HD, D2, Kr and Xe on MgO and BN substrates and in porous media; measurements on the relaxation of dilute light impurities and on the structural transitions they may induce.\n",
      "a9002859 EAR $37125 Recent studies on the origin and development of continental rifts have clearly been hampered by our lack of knowledge on the deep structure of the East African Rift. This classic rift is the standard by which all others are measured. This grant is one of six collaborative grants which support U.S. participation in an international effort to conduct a cooperative study of the Kenyan, Federal Republic of Germany and the European Economic Community, with additional participation by France, Holland, Spain and Ireland, as well as Kenya. This award provides travel, per diem and miscellaneous expenses support for personnel from the U. S. Geological Survey which has a major role. A preliminary experiment was completed in 1985. The results of this experiment suggest that the deep structure of the Kenya Rift is different than anticipated and that the major phase of the project is both scientifically valid and logistically feasible. The major seismic experiment is aimed at determining lithospheric structure in the rift and in adjacent areas. Structure of the sub-Moho lithosphere along the rift, detailed structure in the axial area of the rift, and the transition zones between the rift and adjacent areas are the prime areas of emphasis.\n",

Naval Academy, and the University of Kentucky to study the collectively excited structure of 140Ce. Inelastic neutron scattering will be used to bombard isotopically enriched Ce targets for this work. The quadrupole and octopole excitations can be understood from measurements of elastic and inelastic differential neutron cross sections. Additionally, the states of 127Xe will be studied by means of the 127I(p,n) reaction because of the importance of 127Xe as a neutrino detector. Completion of some work involving a systematic study of nuclei in the Pb region is also planned as part of this grant.\n",
      "a9002863 PHY $241500 The proposed research will continue a program aimed at accurate theoretical prediction of the properties of strongly-interacting quantum many-body systems, at the microscopic level defined by the basic forces between the constituents. The systems of interest include superfluid liquid helium-four unpolarized and polarized liquid helium-three, spin-aligned bulk atomic hydrogen and deuterium, nuclear matter, neutron matter, nuclei, and strongly-coupled electronic systems. Both static and dynamic properties of selected examples, notably the helium liquids, nuclei, and nuclear matter, will be calculated. Special emphasis is placed on predictions which can be compared with the results of current experiments designed to probe the correlation structure of many-body systems. Such experiments include deep- inelastic neutron scattering from liquid helium (e.g. at the Argonne IPNS facility) and inclusive electron scattering from nuclei at GeV energies (e.g. at CEBAF). The basic goal is a deeper understanding of the breakdown of meanfield pictures due to dynamical correlations. The primary theoretical tools are the method of correlated basis functions and self-consistent Green's function theory, applied in parallel or joint investigations.\n",
      "a9002865 CMS $9629 This research program is part of the initiative to collect perishable data resulting from the 17 October 1989 Northern California (Loma Prieta) earthquake. This is a collaborative project with Professor G. Wayne Clough at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. The Earth Technology Corporation, Long Beach, California, is assisting in obtaining the field data: in addition Drs. Geoffrey Martin and Edward Kavazanjian of Earth Technology Corporation are providing technical assistance to the project. Drs. Clough, Chameau, and Kavazanjian during the period 1979-1985 investigated the soil response and soil failures expected in the Bay Area as a result of a large earthquake: however the effects observed as a result of the Loma Prieta earthquake appear to be more extensive than was expected, in part because the ground motions were more severe than anticipated from data existing ten years ago. The project is utilizing these previous studies, focusing on the areas that suffered significant ground failures, such as the Marina District. At the same time it is using the improved understanding of ground failure mechanisms that has occurred since the original studies were undertaken. The objectives of this project are: to gather relevant geotechnical data obtained since 1980; to map ground features that are important to identify the extent of liquefaction and ground amplification effects; perform about 30 cone penetration tests at locations where earlier tests had been conducted; organize the above information into a computerized data base; and make preliminary assessments of the correlation between field observations and data obtained before and after the 1989 earthquake.\n",

      "a9002867 BES $93100 This is an award to provide partial support for a comprehensive study of issues in waste management that impact on the environmental quality of the urban coastal waters of the United States. Issues to be addressed by the Water Science Technology Board of the National Research Council in this study, include the effects on coastal water quality produced both by point discharges of wastes and pollutants from diffuse, non-point sources. Effects to be considered include biostimulation of nuisance organisms and aquatic plants, the excessive growth and presence of which degrades coastal water quality and factors that directly impact on environmental quality and public health. Additional support for this project is expected from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, state and local governmental agencies, and from the National Academy of Engineering. This project is expected to provide a basis for determining research needed for more appropriate utilization of coastal waters in management of waste discharges. This is likely to include a search for innovative processes and systems to prepare wastes for ocean placement; better models of diffusion, dispersion and pollutant interactions as they are affected by physical, chemical and biological processes to determine their environmental effects; for determining the placement of pollution abatement facilities and their engineering design; and engineering systems for response to normal and accidental discharge of pollutants from marine vessels.\n",
      "a9002868 BES $118187 This research addresses the inverse problem in underwater acoustics and shows how it may be solved for the case of finite oceans with depth varying index of refraction. There are two difficulties which must be resolved. The first has to do with the interaction of the ocean surface and bottom. Preliminary computations and graphics show that this problem has been taken care of using our version of the far-field function array. For more resolution we propose using more propagating modes. The procedure will require, however, an increased cpu time. To take into account the effects of a variable index of refraction, we make use of transmutation, a procedure which relates solutions of complicated differential equations to simpler ones. We have shown how, using transmutation, we may compute the \"perturbed modes\", and the propagating Green's function. Initial computations with small wave number were promising.\n",
      "a9002869 OPP $35316 This Small Grant and Exploratory Research (SGER) proposal supports the research to assess the feasibility of isolating a specific enzyme, ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase and oxygenase complex, from primitive microorganisms, which live within sandstone in the Ross Desert region of Antarctica. These primitive microbes include primary producers (lichens, green algae and blue-green algae) and primary consumers (bacteria, yeasts, and fungi) and occasionally metabolize under extreme environmental conditions of temperatures, light, moisture and inorganic nutrients. The carboxylase-oxygenase system will be studied to determine whether it has unique sequences in its amino acids which may contribute to its ability to function under extreme environmental stress. If unique amino acid sequences are found, nucleotide sequences in the gene that codes for this enzyme complex will be examined. This information should provide some understanding as to the evolutionary relatedness of this enzyme compared to temperate species.\n",

      "a9002872 OPP $78620 The Antarctic is now experiencing large springtime losses of stratospheric ozone, resulting in an increase in ultraviolet B (UVB, 280-320nm) radiation. The magnitude of ultraviolet radiation reaching the surface now approaches that measured in tropical latitudes. Perhaps more importantly, UVB radiation has increased in the Antarctic while both UVA (320-400nm) and photosynthetically available radiation (PAR, 400-700nm) have remained unchanged. Recent improvements in atmospheric modeling and technology in oceanographic instrumentation will be used in a six week field study during the austral spring 1990. The prime objective will be to document the impact of UV radiation on the phytoplankton community during the ice-edge spring bloom. During this time, oceanographic processes create favorable conditions for increased UVB susceptibility. Biological and bio-optical information will be used to define and quantify linkages between ozone-dependent oscillations in UV to PAR ratios and phytoplankton productivity. Special emphasis will be place on defining biological restraints imposed by enhanced UVB and altered UVB:UVA:PAR ratios on the balance of UVB photodamage to photorepair, photoprotective and photosynthetic mechanisms operating in the Southern Ocean. The overall aim is to test the hypothesis that phytoplankton in Antarctic waters are adversely influenced by ozone depletion.\n",

Rudolph and studied previously by Silva and Rudolph, will play a pivotal role in Silva's study of nonsingular infinite measure- preserving transformations. This project involves research in ergodic theory. Ergodic theory in general concerns understanding the average behavior of systems whose dynamics is too complicated or chaotic to be followed in microscopic detail. Usually ergodic theory involves a dynamics which preserves a natural probability measure. Professor Silva's research concerns systems where this nice property fails to hold.\n",
      "a9002876 DMS $31350 This award supports the research in analytic number theory of Professor Julia Mueller of Fordham University. Dr. Mueller will be conducting studies in diophantine approximation over both function fields and number fields. In the number-field case, she hopes to reformulate Siegel's conjecture so that all the parameters will be invariant under the special linear group, and thereby to get much more precise statements on the relationship between the coefficients and the number of solutions of the equations under consideration. The field of analytic number theory applies to the discrete realm of the whole numbers the techniques of analysis, dependent on the notions of continuity and limit, originating in calculus. The idea of using continuous methods to investigate the discrete is two centuries old, but with the work of the modern analytic number theorists such as Professor Mueller, the field has had a new rebirth.\n",
      "a9002878 INT $19482 This U.S.-Italy award will support an interdisciplinary meeting in Manziana, Italy on the topic of copper in biological systems. The meeting, organized by Professor Jack Peisach of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University and Professor Bruno Mondovi of the University of Rome \"La Sapienza,\" will include 15 participants from twelve countries besides the U.S. and Italy. The emphasis will be on non-blue copper oxidases, although sessions devoted to blue copper, hemocyanin, cytochrome oxidase, and the role of copper in toxicity and detoxification mechanisms will be included. Copper plays a vital role in biological systems. It is an essential transition metal required for enzymatic reactions, bioenergetic processes, and for structural integrity of some proteins. In excess, it can be toxic, both through its role as a heavy metal intoxicant, but also in reactions that generate toxic oxygen species. Considering the importance of biological copper systems, it is not surprising that they remain under vigorous investigation in numerous laboratories throughout the United States, Italy, and other parts of the world. Although the topic has been discussed at various scientific meetings, the Manzania meetings have been exceptional for the breadth of their multidisciplinary approach and their specific focus on copper research. The introduction of several important techniques in the field can be traced back to the impact of past Manzania meetings. In addition to acting as a clearing house for a multidisciplinary approach, the Manzania meetings have provided a nurturing scientific environment for young investigators. In the five years since the last Manziana meeting, the direction of the field has changed considerably and new approaches and understanding of the role of metals in biology make the case for a meeting on this topic.\n",
      "a9002884 DMS $43700 Numerical analysis is of importance in an increasing number of areas, owing in part to the ever - expanding role of computation in the mathematical sciences. Many algorithms in numerical analysis use polynomials orthogonal on (a subset of) a real interval. These algorithms include schemes for polynomial least squares approximation, Gaussian quadrature, and the Lanczos and conjugate gradient methods. It is planned to develop analogous algorithms that use polynomials orthogonal on the unit circle, also known as Szego polynomials. Szego polynomials are related to approximation by trigonometric polynomials, similarly as polynomials orthogonal on an interval are related to approximation by (algebraic) polynomials. Szego polynomials satisfy a recurrence relation with few terms. This makes them attractive to use in computations. They have already been applied successfully in algorithms for computing eigenvalues of unitary matrices, a problem that arises in certain frequency estimation methods in signal processing.\n",
      "a9002885 HRD $89080 Broken, disarticulated fossils record by their preservation state the physical history of transport, reworking, and length of exposure before final burial and preservation of the organisms. Thus, taphonomic data (e.g., patterns of breakage and wear) are used as paleoecological indicators of physical factors such as relative environmental energy and sedimentation rate. Taphonomic data have a second, separate significance for paleobiologists: they also reflect underlying paleobiologic control (e.g., the mechanical strength of the skeleton). This second aspect of taphonomic information is only beginning to be studied in a systematic way. The purpose of this research is to document patterns in: (1) breakage/wear/damage of exoskeletons and (2) the distribution of epibionts on fossil marine invertebrates. The goal of this work is to interpret these patterns in terms of underlying paleobiological factors such as the mechanical strength of the skeleton, predator/prey relationships, and life orientation of the organism. Understanding the biological basis of taphonomic patterns is necessary to accurately interpret the history (e.g., the mode of formation) of fossiliferous assemblages. This type of research is a prerequisite for taphonomic studies that consider fossils as sedimentary particles. This initial study will examine several genera of Late Ordovician trilobites from the Cincinnati arch region. Subsequent studies will focus on different taxonomic groups, and the long-term goal is to compare the taphonomic patterns of this fauna with faunas from other depositional settings and geologic periods. The interactive component of this project includes the following: a) primary teaching responsibility for an undergraduate course in geology, b) participation in a graduate seminar in paleontology, c) departmental guest lecture, d) a \"Women in Geoscience\" guest lecture series, and e) various mentor/counseling activities. This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering by providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers employed in industry, government, and academic institutions. By encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a valuable investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.\n",
      "a9002890 DMR $190000 This project consists of an experimental study of the first onset of dissipation in the flow of superfluid 4He through an orifice of micron or submicron dimensions as the rate of flow surpasses a critical threshold. Measurements will be made of the magnitude of the critical rate of flow and its dependence on temperature, pressure, and shape of orifice and of any statistical rounding of the onset as a function of temperature, in order to gain information about the fundamental processes involved, for which no satisfactory model now exists. Use will be made of a small mechanical resonator capable of resolving single-quantum-vortex events in the oscillatory flow of superfluid through an orifice that is fabricated by means of electron-beam lithography and ion- beam milling or reactive plasma etching. Studies will be made using both a single-hole configuration and a closed-loop configuration analogous to an rf-biased superconducting quantum interference device.\n",
      "a9002891 CCR $349630 Graph traversal is a fundamental computational problem, not only because it is the natural abstraction of many search problems, but also because its complexity is at the root of important relationships among deterministic, nondeterministic, and probabilistic computations. Significant progress has been made during the last two years toward understanding the complexity of graph traversal. Viewing the problem in its natural structured setting was crucial to most or all of these advances. This project is following a number of approaches to investigate the time and space complexity of graph traversal in structured settings. The goal is to obtain stronger results in the previously studied structured settings, and novel results in substantially richer structured settings. Similarly, structured views of important algebraic problems such as matrix multiplication have been instrumental in advances toward understanding those problems. The project is also investigating the communication and space complexity of these problems, motivated by the importance of communication in parallel and distributed computation.\n",
      "a9002893 ATM $25100 Accurate modelling of the global distribution of trace gases in the atmosphere is necessary to understand the sources and sinks (chemical , physical or biological) that control the global budgets of the radiatively and chemically important gases. This effort continues the basic studies in theoretical modeling of the global composition of the atmosphere. First an investigation of how to improve the manner in which the physical / chemical process in global 3-D models (e.g., chemistry, transport and diffusion) are coupled with the high-order numerical methods used in calculating the transport of tracers, will be undertaken. Second, the developments of current research on three-dimensional chemical transport models (CTM) for stratospheric ozone will be used to examine how stratosphere-troposphere exchange controls the abundances of O3 and NOy in the upper troposphere.\n",
      "a9002894 SES $28000 This one year, full-time award enables a new PhD in anthropologyto develop her understanding of the scientific approaches to management of natural resources, specifically oyster reefs. She will undertake a one-year course of study in the Department of Wildlife and Fisheries Management at Texas A&M University, sponsored by Dr. David J. Schmidly, Head of the Department. Attending classes with future regulatory employees, she will learn about the scientific models on which resource management is based, including oyster biology, population dynamics, economics, growth, habitat and histories of local reefs. At the same time, field work in the Galveston Bay area among oyster fishermen will focus on elucidating the elements of indigenous models -- the local knowledge fishermen use in managing their resource. Anthropological literature has shown that fishermen often have models for self-regulation which are not apparent to regulatory agencies or to scientists. Bureaucrats often introduce management regimes with the assumption that fishermen have no management system (formal or informal) or use one that must be ineffective since it is not based on scientific information. This project hypothesizes that 1) adverse socio-economic impacts from the institution of rationalized management will be lessened if existing informal management systems are, where possible, incorporated, and 2) both types of management models must be explicit for this to happen. The project goal is to enable scientists to incorporate appropriate indigenous strategies and to give fishermen a voice in management of their local resources. This project addresses a central issue in both theory and practice in science studies: the relationship between formalized, scientific ways of knowing and the informal experience-based methods by which communities negotiate priorities and practices. The investigator and her host specialist and host institution are uniquely well-qualified to undertake and support this project; research and related activities are likely to continue after the period of the award. Results are likely to be appropriately disseminated and useful. An award in the amount of $28,000 is therefore recommended.\n",

The notion of a C* algebra is an abstraction of the idea of a family of linear transformations on a space. These transformations can also be thought of as objects that have values in certain states of the space, and the property of this family which is responsible for the symbol * is that the algebra is generated by transformations whose values in these states are real numbers. The fact that these objects appear naturally in many branches of mathematics and physics make them important to study.\n",

      "a9002901 BCS $7690 Under the direction of Dr. Eugene Giles, Ms. Jolee West, a graduate student at the University of Illinois at Urbana, will conduct research for her doctoral dissertation. She will combine field and laboratory work to study the distribution of reptilian remains - crocodile and turtle - on the East African landscape and determine the causal factors of the patterns observed. In particular, she wishes to learn how humanly derived assemblages may be identified. To accomplish this, she will first focus her attention on areas located on the Eastern shore of Lake Turkana, Kenya which are not inhabited by people. She will establish transects which extend away from water sources and collect reptilian remains along them. This will provide data on \"natural\" or non-human patterning. She will then work with traditional peoples who live near the lake margin and hunt and butcher these same species. A comparison of these samples should permit identification of uniquely human signatures. Ms. West will also examine reptile remains from hyena lairs, study bone weathering, and conduct flume experiments to show the differential effects of water movement. This basic research will provide archaeologists with extremely valuable data. Crocodile and turtle remains are often recovered during the excavation of early hominid sites in East Africa. However, it is extremely difficult to determine the derivation of these remains which also occur naturally as a scatter across African landscapes. It is not possible therefore to tell whether such species formed part of early hominid diet or whether the association of these bones occurs by chance. Ms. West's project will provide the key for such interpretation. This project is important for several reasons. First, it will provide a tool of use in a wide range of archaeological situations. Secondly, it will assist in the training of an extremely promising young scientist.\n",
      "a9002904 DMS $40286 Work on this project will concentrate on problems arising in the analysis of algebras generated by holomorphic or harmonic functions (function algebras). A metric is used to measure the distance between any two functions consisting of the maximum of the function value differences, often referred to as the uniform norm. The underlying theme of the work concerns algebras of functions which lie between familiar algebras. On a compact set in the plane one considers the effect of adjoining a function to a given function algebra (of holomorphic functions) and then completing the new collection into a larger algebra. A fundamental question is whether or not the new algebra consists of all continuous functions if the additional function was harmonic. This is resolved in a recent work if the harmonic function is real-valued. A clarification of the situation when it is complex-valued remains to be done. Some progress has also been made in the setting of several complex variables, where the same basic questions can be raised. At the present time, the domains are restricted to balls and the functions adjoined to the ball algebra of continuous holomorphic functions must have continuous first derivatives. A second goal of this work will be to relax the differentiability condition which appears to be unnecessary.\n",

Internationally recognized experts will participate in this Conference and participate in presentations of 80 papers and a series of symposia. Topics include health, resource utilization, ethnoarchaeology, education, language and land use issues. Approximately one-third of the papers will address northern societies, with representatives of all Arctic countries participating.

      "a9002912 DMS $43690 Professor Kraus will investigate some questions concerning tensor products and approximation properties of weakly closed subspaces of the algebra of bounded operators on a Hilbert space, and some similar questions for operator spaces. In particular, he will investigate the problem of whether all CSL algebras have a certain weak approximation property which guarantees that the algebras behave well under tensoring. Other projects involve the study of the class of groups whose associated von Neumann algebras have this approximation property, and the study of other related approximation properties. This project involves the study of operators on Hilbert spaces. Hilbert space operators are essentially infinite matrices of complex numbers. These operators have applications in every area of applied science as well as in pure mathematics. This research is an attempt to understand how algebras of these operators acting on independent Hilbert spaces behave when they are combined by taking the tensor product of these spaces.\n",
      "a9002914 DMS $33010 The purpose of this project is to study a new class of rank statistics for analyzing nonserial dependent data with missing observations. The dependencies are assumed to come from multivariate data or repeated measures data. Nonparametric methods which do not involve the assumption of normally distributed data are to be developed. The testing and estimation procedures proposed will be based on asymptotic distributions of ranks of dependent data. They incorporate intercomponent and interblock rankings and, as a result, are applicable to a much wider class of problems with nonserial dependent data. They will also have improved power properties.\n",
      "a9002917 HRD $88034 Potential applications will be investigated of artificial intelligence and expert systems to the design and operation of materials logistics systems within semiconductor manufacturing. The United States semiconductor industry faces considerable pressure from international competition in a time of rapidly changing products and processes. Problems such as scheduling and dispatching within a production line are computationally intractible and must rely on heuristics for system operation. Their complexity, size, and stochastic variability suggest that they are best addressed by a combination of techniques from Operations Research and Artificial Intelligence. Dr. Shilepsky will bring together current models from Operations Research, scaling to reduce problem size, and embedded AI submodules in the form of expert systems, neural nets, and/or space state search to develop new models for production planning. The interactive activities include teaching two courses during each of the fall and spring semesters selected from Introduction to Engineering Probability, Introduction to Stochastic Processes, and Inventory Theory. In addition, Dr. Shilepsky will advise 10 undergraduate and 5 graduate students, supervising a master's degree project in conjunction with the proposed research. This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering by providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.

      "a9002919 DMS $217500 The three principal investigators propose to conduct research into the mathematical theory of control, stabilization, and optimization of infinite dimensional systems - in particular, distributed parameter systems governed by partial differential equations (PDE) and hereditary systems governed by differential- delay (DDE) or more general functional -differential equations (FDE). These investigations will concentrate on the problems of Hybrid Control Systems in which an infinite dimensional system is linked or coupled to a simpler system, usually a finite dimensional process controlled through ordinary differential equations (ODE). These mathematical questions are motivated by a multitude of control-theoretic problems of importance in current advanced engineering projects (aerospace guidance, space platform and space station control and stabilization), as well as in industrial engineering projects (tape processing). In this sense the investigators recognize the two-way interaction between classical mathematical analysis, and physical and engineering sciences; but this research project will concentrate on the mathematical side, although the research will necessarily be motivated by the areas of applications.\n",
      "a9002923 DMS $15800 Frohman intends to study problems relating to the geometry and topology of three-dimensional manifolds. His research is developing along two lines. The first aims to finish the uniqueness part of the topological classification of minimal surfaces in R3.

      "a9002930 DMS $178700 Solovay plans to investigate various questions in mathematical logic, including questions concerning models of inductive inference, exotic Boolean algebras, and the consistency of Quine's system of set-theory, \"New Foundations.\" In addition, work is planned on the following topics: reconstructing Godel's proof of the independence of the axiom of choice; cutting down his backlog of unpublished papers; learning more about neural nets and neurobiology; and learning more about random graphs with hopes that it has applications to complexity theory.\n",
      "a9002931 AST $5500 While warped disks and gaseous rings of spiral galaxies are rare, where they exist they can be powerful diagnostics of dynamical processes which apply in all galaxies. They are also being discovered with increasing frequency. This grant provides partial support for an international conference of active workers studying these puzzling objects. The proximity of the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center to the meeting is expected to stimulate fruitful interactions between specialists in numerical simulation and observers, particularly those specializing in studies of the motion and distribution of neutral hydrogen.\n",
      "a9002936 ATM $161334 To obtain useful predictions beyond a few days requires that both cloudiness and radiation processes be accurately represented in a numerical weather prediction model. Since it is not possible to represent all physical processes on all scales explicitly, it is necessary to use physically based sub-grid scale parameterizations. The goal of this project is to evaluate the current cloud generation and radiation schemes used in the National Meteorological Center (NMC)'s operational global model and to evaluate the sensitivity of forecasts to those schemes. Based on the analyses, the PI will suggest improvements to the schemes. The results of this study should be relevant for climate as well as weather models. This project is part of a joint program in numerical weather prediction sponsored by NSF and NOAA's NMC. The principal investigator and his colleagues will work closely with NMC staff during the research.\n",
      "a9002938 PHY $50868 This grant provides partial support for the collaboration of Prof. Jeffrey R. Vanhoy, U. S. Naval Academy, Prof. Sally F. Hicks, University of Dallas, and the University of Kentucky to study the collectively excited structure of 140Ce. Inelastic neutron scattering will be used to bombard isotopically enriched Ce targets for this work. The quadrupole and octopole excitations can be understood from measurements of elastic and inelastic differential neutron cross sections. Additionally, the states of 127Xe will be studied by means of the 127I(p,n) reaction because of the importance of 127Xe as a neutrino detector. An investigation will be undertaken as part of this grant to understand how neutron polarization is modified as a neutron beam passes through a thick aligned or polarized target. Neutron resonance parameters can be used to clarify aspects of polarized neutron transport through the targets used at LANL-LANSCE in parity and time-reversal violation experiments.\n",
      "a9002939 DMS $142700 This award supports the research in number theory of Professor Hendrik Lenstra of the University of California at Berkeley. Dr. Lenstra has proposed to continue his research in several directions. In primality testing and factorization of large integers, he will study the newest factoring algorithm, known as the Number Field Sieve, and work on the practical implementation of a primality test. In algebraic number theory, he will investigate the existence of governing fields and study the class group structure of abelian fields. Except for counting, number theory, which is the study of the properties of the whole numbers, is the oldest branch of mathematics. In modern days, problems in number theory have furnished the driving force to creation of new mathematics in the fields of pure algebra, analysis, and geometry; some of the most recent and most astonishing applications of number theory have appeared in theoretical computer science and coding theory.\n",
      "a9002942 DMR $95000 This research involves the investigation of amorphous hydrogenated silicon-carbon alloys by a combination of junction capacitance techniques. The intention is to study the detailed energy map of amorphous hydrogenated silicon-carbon films deep defect density-of-states (DOS) over a significant portion of the mobility gap. Photocapacitance spectrocopy will provide an accurate energy map of deep defects to a depth of 1.1 eV below the mobility edge. A series of high quality samples will be prepared by Shing of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory employing a Glasstech PECVD system. The research will involve undergraduates in every aspect of the proposed study. Initial measurements will involve capacitance-temperature measurements. This work will aid in the development of optoelectronic devices such as photovoltaic cells.\n",
      "a9002943 DMS $164806 This project will concentrate on the role of reaction- diffusion equations in mathematical ecology. Population dynamics for communities in heterogeneous environments will be considered. It is expected that substantial progress will be made by employing mathematical tools such as the concepts of persistence and permanence in dynamical systems. The notion of skew-product flow will be applied to study species and community models which involve temporal and spatial heterogeneity. It is also planned to investigate the relation between reaction-diffusion models and the theory of island biogeography.\n",
      "a9002947 EAR $135000 This research is to use seismological, thermodynamic, mineral physics and experimental petrological data to infer, with error estimates, the mineralogy of the various regions of the mantle. Recent seismological work is providing high-resolution models for the radial variation, and useful resolution for lateral variation of seismic properties. The absolute values of these parameters, their gradients and their interrelationships provide data pertinent to the chemistry, mineralogy and temperature of the mantle. Two of the outstanding questions in mantle dynamics and chemistry are whether mantle discontinuities represent chemical as well as phase changes and whether the lateral variations are entirely due to temperature. Recent work on the elastic properties of perovskite and on the partitioning of Fe between perovskite and magnesiowustite will help us constrain the chemistry and thermodynamics of the lower mantle.\n",
      "a9002951 DMS $29000 In the work supported by this award the principal investigator will extend some of his work on the infinite-line Kaup-Newell perturbation theory for a single soliton solution of a nonlinear Schroedinger system to the multiple soliton case. This work has applications to the transmission of data in the form of wave packets through nonlinear optical fibers, and so such it is highly relevant to the design of modern communications' systems that utilize optical fiber technology. The principal investigator will employ methods based upon asymptotics in order to study the behavior of solutions of nonlinear systems of partial differential equations. Every day, it seems, there are articles in the newspapers about the use of fiber optics technologies in the design of modern communications systems. Indeed, telephone companies and computer companies are very much interested in designing \"lossless\" ways of transmitting data. One possible solution is the emerging technologies based upon fiber optics, since fiber optics affords the potential of transmitting data without significant dispersion or distortion. With this award the principal investigator will study solutions of the nonlinear system of equations that describes the propagation of waves through optical fibers.\n",
      "a9002952 DMS $58500 In this project the principal investigators will analyze systems of differential equations whose solutions model several types of reactive thermal explosions. In particular, they will study the qualitative properties of solutions of initial-boundary value problems that describe the evolution of diffusive and nondiffusive thermal explosions in finite domains. The goal of this investigation is to predict precisely where and when explosions will occur and to study how the solution behaves as the blow-up time approaches. Combustion phenomena are common in many aspects of our daily lives; think of cars, kitchens, heating systems, rocket and missile engines. A large amount of computer power is brought to bear upon the systems of partial differential equations that describe combustion and explosion phenomena, but very often a great deal of insight can be obtained from a mathematical analysis of the governing equations. For example, in this project the principal investigators will attempt to predict where and when an explosion will occur in a confined space by means of a judicious use of a'priori estimates and bounding functions.\n",
      "a9002955 DMS $43950 The principal investigator will conduct research in an area of mathematics which involves differential geometry and several complex variables. The problems to be investigated concern the intrinsic geometry of convex domains based on rescaling and distortion theorems, compact complex manifolds and harmonic maps, and canonical structures on the boundary of hyperbolic space. The research to be conducted by the principal investigator involves differential geometry, convexity, and the theory of several complex variables. The first is an outgrowth of Newton's calculus and involves rates of change on surfaces. The second is the study of shapes which have no indentations. And the third is an area of analysis where functions have more than one independent complex variable instead of several real variables, as is the usual.\n",
      "a9002957 HRD $106272 IR and SS-NMR studies of supported iron carbidocarbonyl clusters will be conducted. This research combines expertise developed in the field of supported metal catalyst chemistry with that of organometallic chemistry and homogeneous catalysis. Borrowing from surface chemistry techniques, metal clusters will be anchored to supports to provide them with an environment more similar to that of a heterogeneous catalyst is usually found. In this environment, the metal cluster will be subjected to thermal and chemical treatments while monitoring the transformations that the ligands and the metal framework undergo. An effort will be made to probe the molecular chemistry of the supported cluster system and compare the observations with the known solution chemistry of the unsupported cluster and the less-well-defined surface chemistry of related adsorbate-metal surface systems. The studies will provide an understanding of the structure of the cluster systems throughout these interactions, giving the potential to develop a fundamental understanding of a wide range of metal-organic interactions that may provide invaluable clues concerning similar interactions on metal surfaces. Interactive activities include a workshop for women undergraduates entitled, \"Graduate Education in Chemical Engineering.\" This activity will help encourage young women to consider careers in scientific research. In addition, a graduate course on topics in catalysis will be taught. This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering by providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.

      "a9002958 DMS $236019 Professor Salinas will pursue his research on multivariable operator theory, including Toeplitz C* algebras on bounded domains in n variables, weighted Wiener-Hopf operators, and joint quasitriangularity of operators and quasidiagonality of C* algebras. Professor Upmeier will continue and expand his work on multivariable Toeplitz operators, C* algebras, and index theory. He will also study quantization procedures on manifolds. Dr. Zhang will continue his work on the structure of certain simple C* algebras and multiplier and corona algebras of certain types of C* algebras. The notion of a C* algebra is an abstraction of the idea of a family of linear transformations on a space. These transformations can also be thought of as having values in the states of the space, and the property of this family which is responsible for the symbol * is that the algebra is generated by transformations whose values in these states are real numbers. The fact that these objects appear naturally in many branches of mathematics and physics make them important to study.\n",
      "a9002960 HRD $113339 This research project will concentrate on the analysis of the low resolution spectra obtained with IRAS in order to establish the characteristic dust grain signatures found in the 8-22 micron region. With these spectra, Dr. Little-Marenin will be able to investigate and possibly extend the chronology of dust formation and microwave maser development in relatively older and optically thick circumstellar shells associated with M stars. The time variability of the emission from the circumstellar shells will be investigated by analyzing the IRAS broad band fluxes and the spectra of individual IRAS observations. Analysis of the emission and absorption features observed in the circumstellar shells associated with C stars should provide observational evidence for the carbon-bearing dust grain formation sequence that has been proposed. In addition, Dr. Little-Marenin will teach an Introductory Astronomy course, develop a research seminar on the late stages of stellar evolution and organize a lecture series given by women astronomers. She will also give departmental colloquia, seminars and informal presentations.

The goal of the project is to attain a better understanding of nuclear matter that is far from its equilibrium state, an objective that has been identified as top priority in the subfield of nuclear physics. The proposed work will include interpretations of results using collision simulation codes based on the most recent developments in nuclear transport theory. Much of the work will be conducted using a dedicated computer facility at the Harbin institute. The Chinese researchers will re.analyze existing BEVALAC data containing multi.particle correlation information for both pions and nucleons.

      "a9002964 HRD $113440 The control of queueing (service) systems is increasingly important in the areas of communication systems, computer networks, and manufacturing. It is desired to determine control policies that are optimal and easy to implement. Underlying many queueing control problems is a mathematical structure known as a Markov decision process (MDP). Dr. Sennott will establish the existence of optimal policies in general state space MDPs, in partially observable MDPs, in MDPs with constraints, and in stochastic games. Lastly, she will study finite state approximations for infinite state MDPs. Examples illustrate the applicability of each topic to the control of queueing systems. The methods employed will be extensions of her developments (1989a, b, c).

      "a9002977 HRD $82117 Approximately three million years ago the emergence of the Isthmus of Panama from the sea divided the American tropical marine fauna in two, profoundly affecting the evolution and geographic distribution of many animals. The time of severance of deep.water connections has been studied, but Dr. Collins will determine the time of final closure using shallow.water benthic foraminifera. Fossil species of these abundant protists indicate the water depths in which they formerly lived. From strata dated with the newest biostratigraphic zonations, a sequence of water depths through time from both sides of the isthmus will be combined with taxonomic data on the biogeographic divergence of East Pacific and Caribbean foraminifera to date and the final closure of the isthmus. Standard laboratory and analytical methods will be used. The date of termination of the marine connection is important to evolutionary studies in paleontology, molecular biological studies of rates of genetic divergence, and calculations of regional tectonic uplift and the terrestrial interchange of South and North American vertebrates. Interactions with the host institution include: teaching an undergraduate course in biostratigraphy, leading a graduate seminar in paleobiogeography, co-teaching summer geology field camp, and arranging guest lectures by established women paleontologists.

      "a9002984 MCB $240050 Fluorescence polarization and energy transfer is used to probe the conformational dynamics of two light-activated proteins, rhodopsin and bacteriorhodopsin. Over the years, these proteins have provided important model systems for receptor action and ion transport, respectively. The goal of the present study is to investigate changes in protein flexibility as a result of conformational transitions. These systems are especially convenient for this purpose because of the ease of inducing transitions with light. These experiments should provide unique information on how protein dynamics influence conformational transitions. Phase lifetime spectroscopy is used to measure changes in fluorescence energy transfer and fluorescence polarization in bacteriorhodopsin as it proceeds through its proton-pumping photocycle. This novel technique will allow changes in position of the chromophore, retinal, to be monitored for intermediates which exist on the millisecond time scale. In the rhodopsin work, fluorescence labels are attached to a site located on the carboxyl tail which is thought to anchor the tail to the membrane. The membrane location of the this site will be established using fluorescence energy transfer. Fluorescence anisotropy measurements will be used to characterize the motion of the \"tethered tail\". Finally, theoretical models will be investigated to provide link between molecular dynamics and conformational changes.\n",

He will spend a year at the University of California at San Diego, working with two host scholars. Political scientist Sanford Lakoff studies the interaction of science and government; Herbert York, director emeritus of the Institute on Global Conflict and Cooperation, is an experienced government servant and international negotiator on arms control and other technology/society issues. Professor Lakoff will guide Professor Casper's study and analysis of concepts in democratic theory such as \"political accountability\" and \"public right to know,\" and consideration of how such concepts might be operationalized. Professor York will guide his study and analysis of how scientists have both empowered and legitimated, and disempowered and delegitimated citizen involvement. The project will place particular emphasis on important new roles for colleges and universities in providing citizens access to information and expertise. Among the concrete products of the project will be a series of articles and a book, tentatively titled Experts, Information and Political Empowerment. This project addresses a central issue in ethics and values studies: the social values and mutual obligations and responsibilities that arise in the interactions between scientists, engineers, and citizens. The investigator and his host specialists and host institution are uniquely well-qualified to undertake and support this project; research and related activities are likely to continue after the period of the award. Results are likely to be appropriately disseminated and useful. An award in the amount ofd $43,000 is therefore recommended.\n",
      "a9002986 CHE $236234 This research is being funded by the Organic Synthesis Program. Dr. Krafft will be continuing her studies of the synthetic potential of cobalt carbonyl complexes as reagents for the controlled construction of five-membered rings. Reagents like this enrich the armamentarium of synthetic organic chemists and provide more powerful synthetic tools for the synthesis of more complex molecules. The work on the directed Pauson reaction has progressed to the point where one can now plan total syntheses with some confidence. The ene-yne cycloaddition is highly regioselective due to the direction by nitrogen or sulfur ligands tethered to the alkene. Further work is planned to improve the synthetic efficiency of the directed Pauson reaction. Some efforts are now directed toward the total synthesis of asteriscanolide. Two different approaches are being examined. An asymmetric modification of the Pauson cycloaddition is also under investigation. Other reactions using alkyne-cobalt carbonyls are underway, i.e. selective oxidations and sulfoxide reductions. The second part of the project involves the examination of reactions with acylcobalt carbonyl complexes. Earlier work demonstrated that butenolides, with a variety of substitution patterns, can be synthesized in high yield by the reaction of alkynes with acylcobalt carbonyl complexes. One major problem associated with the reaction will be addressed by the use of a directing ligand. The intermediate formed in the reaction is a pi-allyl cobalt complex. The carbon-carbon bond forming reactions of the pi-allyl complex will be investigated. Insertion of acyl cobalt complexes into alkenes and the asymmetric versions of these reactions will also be studied.\n",

His group is studying the local roughness and rigidity of the surface and the effect of solvent molecules on solvation, surface adsorption, and surface chemistry. Under vacuum conditions that suppress collisions in the vapor above the surface, Nathanson uses time-of-flight spectroscopy to measure the details of scattering and adsorption-desorption of individual solute molecules striking the liquid surface. Inert gases and protic solutes such as water and ammonia are being scattered from hydrophobic, hydrogen-bonding, and acidic liquids to learn how the incident collision energy and angle of approach of the impinging beam control adsorption, solvation, and proton exchange at the interface.\n",

Random fields governed by SPDE's have been used intensively in physics, biology, chemistry, and electrical engineering as models for various random phenomena. Substantial progress in this field has been made in the last decade, but still the theory is in its infancy.

      "a9003002 ACI $208880 In the last few years, there has been an increased interest in the study of multilevel preconditioners for solving elliptic problems in conjunction with the conjugate gradient method. Part of the motivation is that these methods are highly parallelizable, in addition to usually possessing good convergence properties, a combination that most of the classical preconditioners (e.g. SSOR, incomplete factorizations and polynomial preconditioners) lack. The authors' previous work in this area has convinced them that this is a very promising approach for constructing efficient and robust iterative methods for solving large elliptic difference equations on massively parallel computers. Continued research in this area, will include a careful study of implementation issues for massively parallel computers such as the CM.2, a theoretical study of the relationships among different multilevel preconditioners and the class of domain decomposition methods, hybrid multilevel methods which retain the nice properties of incomplete factorization methods with respect to non.smooth coefficients, and extensions beyond self-adjoint second order elliptic operators (e.g.indefinite, convection-diffusion and biharmonic operators.)\n",

In the context of this research, the concept of \"protocol\" refers to any system hardware and software that can be modelled by communication finite state machines. The research will address three problems: 1. the distributed diagnosis of protocol faults in distributed systems, 2. the synthesis of protocols whose performance can be controlled, and 3 the generation of test cases for input output testing of protocols for verification and certification.

      "a9003012 MCB $291000 The structure and function of the components of the binding protein mediated membrane transport system for ribose in E. coli will be probed by two main approaches. First, site-directed mutagenesis studies on the ribose binding protein will be continued in order to define the surfaces on the ribose binding protein which interact with the chemotaxis (trg) and the ribose transport receptors on the cytoplasmic membrane. Our recant studies of this type located one site near the \"hinge\" of the binding protein which eliminated chemotaxis when an Ile residue was changed to Arg. Further probing of this site and residues near it are planned as well as sites near the cleft of the binding protein which appear to affect transport. Second, overexpression, isolation, and characterization of the components of the membrane transport complex for ribose will be continued. Two of the three proteins in the complex have been purified, one of which has been shown to be homologous to a family of ATP-binding proteins including the eukaryotic multiple drug resistance proteins and the newly identified cystic fibrosis-related protein. Physical and biochemical studies will be performed on the purified transport protein, and attempts to overexpress the third will be continued. Once all three are produced, reconstitution of the transporter in vitro will be pursued. A reconstituted system, along with the information related to the surface of the binding protein which interacts with the transported, will allow future biochemical studies of the mechanism of transport, A related objective is to overexpress the repressor for the rbs operon, a molecule which was shown to be homologous both to a family of repressors and also to the family of binding proteins to which ribose binding protein belongs. This led to a model for the repressor mechanism which will be testable biochemically and structurally once significant amounts of the pure repressor are obtained.\n",

      "a9003015 CTS $33672 Dr. Choi's group has done some internally funded on the effects of ultrasonic waves on the melting process and has found some very interesting effects. Specifically, he found melting rates enhanced by as much as 250%, modifications to the form of the phase-interface, and a dependance of the behavior on the applied ultrasonic frequency. While the experiments appear to demonstrate an effect, the physics behind the phenomenon have not been elucidated. Dr. Choi proposes to perform similar experiments for the case of solidification. With recent interest in the use of phase- change materials, rate of solidification and void formation during solidification is of extreme importance. If the application of ultrasonic waves can enable the control of the solidification process, a substantial advance will have been made in this technology.\n",
      "a9003018 HRD $110486 Quasicrystalline materials are intriguing because of their fivefold symmetry which is incompatible with periodic translational order. Two models of quasicrystal structure were originally proposed: the quasiperiodic crystal or \"Penrose tiling\" model and the icosahedral glass model. Dr. Strandburg's research, along with that of a number of others, suggested a third possibility - the entropically stabilized or \"random tiling\" model. In this project she will use computer simulation techniques to study: (1) properties of the random tiling model in three dimensions. Results will allow comparisons with experiment, to distinguish between the suggested structural models; and (2) crystal growth and interface roughness of the random tiling model. Nanocrystals are compactions of nanometer-sized crystallites. They have novel properties due to their large density of grain boundaries. The anomalous stability of these materials against grain growth will be investigated using a simple topological model. Interactive activities include a mentorship program pairing female students with women scientists at Argonne and Fermilab; regular gatherings of female physics students for discussion of issues of interest to women in science; Ph.D. thesis research supervision; and teaching introductory undergraduate physics and graduate solid state physics.

      "a9003021 HRD $192750 Current knowledge of the patterns of water and solute regulation in terrestrial vertebrates is based largely on studies of mammals, birds, and amphibians. Studies of reptiles are for the most part limited to turtles and snakes, for which information has only just begun to accumulate, and lizards remain largely unstudied. This research will exploit the ontogenetic variability in osmoregulatory patterns of lizards as the mesonephric kidney ceases to function after birth and the metanephric kidney assumes its adult role in water and ion balance. These investigations are being conducted at several levels: 1) Physiological properties of the whole kidney, as well as of individual nephrons, will be studied with respect to the regulation of filtration and of ion and water balance. 2) The morphological changes that occur in the mesonephric and metanephric kidneys with postnatal development will be documented in terms of both the structural organizations of the tissue and the ultrastructural changes at the cellular level. 3) Information from the physiological and morphological studies will be integrated to yield a picture of the interrelationships between structure and function. This study is the first to examine the osmoregulatory physiology and morphology of a neonatal reptile and in fact represents one of only a very few to study osmoregulation in any newborn vertebrate. The information gained from this study will not only significantly advance our understanding of the patterns of osmoregulation in lizards and other reptiles, but will also provide a basis for understanding the ontogenetic changes in the osmoregulatory roles of the mesonephric and metanephric kidneys both before and after birth in other vertebrates. The interactive activities will involve team-teaching two courses in Physiology as well as presenting research seminars in two departments on campus; and participation in an ongoing seminar on \"Women in the Biological Sciences,\" which centers on gender issues. Dr. Beuchat will also teach a graduate seminar entitled \"On Being a Scientist.\" This seminar will focus on acquisition of information and skills necessary for success in academic science that are not traditionally part of the graduate curriculum. The seminar will include discussions of CV preparation, applying for research grants, giving a talk at a meeting, getting a job in academia, and the ethics of science.

      "a9003030 CCR $47308 With the increased use of automated reasoning systems and the proliferation of parallel machines, the need for research in parallel automated reasoning was never more evident. Coarse grain parallel theorem provers have been developed which demonstrate linear speed-up for small to medium scale problems; however, fine grain provers for very large scale problems have yet to be developed. In this work a SIMD parallel automated reasoning system will be designed based upon the clause graph (or connection graph) model. This system will be implemented on the Connection Machine model CM-2 and will be applied to a number of problems in group theory and combinatorial geometry. In addition, parallel algorithms will be developed for computing and analyzing the spectra of clause graphs.\n",
      "a9003033 DMS $94500 In this award the principal investigator will study a new class of inverse problems called inverse nodal problems. The motivation for this study is the question concerning how much one can say about a vibrating membrane if one knows the nodal lines. The nodal lines are the curves along which the eigenfunctions of the membrane vanish. In one dimension the nodal lines are points (nodes). Nodes are of interest in engineering applications because they represent the optimal locations for the support of a mast or placement of a bearing on a shaft, while nodal lines enter into the analysis of flaws in holographic plates. What can you say about a vibrating string if you know the nodes or a vibrating membrane if you know the nodal lines? Nodal lines are the fixed curves or points on the standing waves generated during the vibration. This is an example of an inverse problem: one attempts to determine an object or process from the data it produces. Such inverse problems have important engineering applications and the principal investigator will employ analytical and numerical methods to study the discontinuous problems and the uniqueness of the density.\n",
      "a9003034 CTS $97959 This project is aimed at developing new conceptual and mathematical methods for the general analysis of mechanical efficiency and performance limitations of reciprocating kinematic heat engines. The project is motivated by two recent discoveries which, taken together, indicate that realistically complex engine mechanisms can be treated in mathematically closed form fashion. The discoveries arose from prior work on establishing mathematically explicit and general limits on the mechanical efficiency of kinematic engines which are analogous to the well known Carnot limits on thermal efficiency. The prior work was restricted to highly idealized engine mechanisms models. The present project makes use of a new abstract approach to model engine mechanisms which allow significant relaxation or essentially complete removal of the idealizations and restrictions of the earlier work. The results of the proposed new work will be more faithfully representative of actual practice while retaining a broad general range of applicability. This will not only provide more detailed insight into the specific practical problems involved in extracting useful work from heat engines, but it will also furnish a new ability to address global problems important to practical heat engine design and development such as the optimal matching of thermodynamic cycles and engine mechanisms.\n",
      "a9003037 DMS $35000 With this award the principal investigators will continue their mathematical analysis of models of reactive thermal explosions. In particular, they will analyze the solutions of initial-boundary value problems that describe the evolution of diffusive and nondiffusive thermal explosions in confined domains, in order to determine where and when explosions will take place. With regard to these latter questions the principal investigators will describe precisely how the blowup singularities evolve in space and time as the blowup time is reached. Natural phenomena involving burning and explosions offer important scientific and technological areas of investigation. As with many physical processes there are generally two avenues for study: the theoretical and the experimental. This award represents the theoretical approach to combustion. In it the principal investigators will use mathematical analysis to determine where and when explosions occur in models of thermally reactive systems in containers and the locations of hotspots.\n",
      "a9003041 HRD $96737 This research on the prairie vole, Microtus ochrogaster, has three objectives: 1) to test the Charnov.Finerty (1980) hypothesis, which proposed that differences in genetic relatedness at high versus low population densities drives vole population cycles: 2) to determine whether the proximate mechanism of this hypothesis is genetic relatedness per se, or familiarity (as suggested by Bekoff 1981); 3) to determine whether either degree of genetic relatedness or familiarity influences the mating system under field conditions. By manipulating matings and housing conditions in the laboratory, four populations of varying degrees of genetic relatedness and familiarity will be created: Kin-Familiar, Kin-Unfamiliar, Non Kin-Familiar, Non-Kin Unfamiliar. These populatins will be released into four field enclosures and live-trapped every two weeks. Wounding (as a measure of aggression), dispersal rates, reproductive condition, population numbers and spacing patterns will be monitored. DNA fingerprinting will be used to determine reproductive success and mating system in each enclosure. The interactive component consists of teaching a graduate seminar on women animal behaviorists, organizing a discussion group for women students and faculty, organizing a symposium on women and science, and presenting a department seminar. This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering by providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.

      "a9003042 SES $28000 Dr. Creager, a trained biochemist, is entering a postdoctoral training and research program at the History of Science Department of Harvard University. Working with Professor Everett Mendelsohn, she is investigating two questions relating to the emergence of molecular biology in this century. First, how did the preexisting program of research on proteins contribute to the ascension of molecular biology and how was that program changed by it? Physiologists and biochemists appropriated experimental methodology from the physical sciences before molecular biologists exploited this approach to answer fundamental questions in genetics. Dr. Creager is examining the development of this physico-chemical approach at the Physical Chemistry Laboratory at Harvard Medical School in the first decades of this century. Second, she is asking is the concept of the molecular biological revolution of the life sciences a suitable or accurate expression of the nature of scientific change in biology in this century. She is studying the relationship of molecular biology to the older field of biochemistry in order to assess whether molecular biology introduced a novel methodology or approach. Her investigations of whether developments in the life sciences in this century have been continuous or discontinuous with previous traditions should provide a basis for assessing the nature of scientific change in modern biology.\n",
      "a9003047 HRD $88620 The main objective of this research is to determine what undergraduate school characteristics and student background factors are associated with persistence in mathematics, natural sciences, and engineering, particularly for women and minority students. The data set is based on a longitudinal sample of 69,000 students who had SAT scores, GRE scores, and accompanying questionnarie responses. These data include major field of study at three points in time: intended major at high school graduation, actual undergraduate major, and intended graduate major. The prediction of persistence in these fields will be analyzed with multinomial logit or logistic regression models. Interactive activities include a course entitled Psychological Measurement in Survey Research, guest lectures on recent works, a talk to students about ETS research and choice of science careers, statistical advising to faculty and students, and participation in social activities with Hispanic and other minority faculty and students.

      "a9003051 HRD $114832 This research is centered on two objectives. One goal is focused on the synthesis and study of new types of metal-thiolate complexes as models for metal-sulfur centers in proteins. Specific systems include analogs for the ?Fe(SR)4!1- center in rubredoxins2- the ?Fe4S4(SR)4!1- center in high potential iron-sulfur proteins, the ?Fe3S4(SR))3!2- center in 3Fe-sulfur proteins, and the ?Ni(III)(SR)n! center in hydrogenases. Another goal is to explore new research directions in the area of metal-oxide compounds as analogs for relevant metal-oxide centers in biology as well as in the industrially important metal- oxide supported catalyst. The reaction chemistry of new types of ligands will be explored. Specifically, compounds that are apt to mimic the iron- or manganese-oxide centers in hemerythrin, ribonucleotide reductase, methane monooxygenase and Photosystem II will be investigated. This research is being pursued with the prospect of obtaining fundamental information about the structural, spectroscopic and reactivity properties of these metal centers in nature. The interactive activities include numerous lectures in graduate chemistry courses, and putting together an industrial scientist- graduate student seminar, directed at enhancing the graduate students' awareness of career opportunities in the chemical industry. This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering by providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.

      "a9003052 HRD $116669 The overall objective of this project is to complete characterization of the hemolytic agent(s) from the human blood parasite Schistosoma mansoni. First it is planned to determine the chemical identity of the lytic agent(s) as well as its metabolic precursors using HPLC techniques and radioactive precursors. Previous studies suggest that the lytic agent can influence the organization and dynamics of the red blood cell (RBC) membrane, therefore, it is proposed to use fluorescence photobleaching recovery techniques to determine changes which occur in the RBC membrane during the lytic process. Finally, the localization of the lytic activity within live schistosomes will be determined. Through this study it is hoped to increase our knowledge on factors influencing red cell membrane dynamics as well our knowledge on direct interactions between a human parasite and the cells of its host. The interactive component will involve lecturing in the regular parasitology course offered to Harvard graduate students, presenting a seminar series for graduate and undergraduate students on \"Careers for Women in Science,\" and participating in the Women in Academic Medicine Network.\" In addition, Dr. Kasschau will discuss careers in Biology and medicine with interested high school students. This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering by providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.

      "a9003056 HRD $97095 Complexity can be considered the primary foundation of theoretical computer science. It is the study of computability with limited resources. A problem that has stimulated a large body of work in structural complexity is whether all sets equivalent under various reductions are polynomially isomorhic. In 1977, J. Hartmanis and L.Berman conjectured that all NP-complete sets are polynomially isomorphic. This is still open. In most instances of difficult problems, it has been straightforward to construct oracles to decide the problems either way. In the case of the isomorphism conjecture, this has not been true. There is no known oracle for which the isomorphism conjecture holds. Dr. Goldsmith will continue to investigate the isomorphism conjecture. She will continue working on self-reducibility and oracle accessibility. She will investigate the difficulty of constructions in complexity theory by analyzing the complexity of the statements of the theorems and the standard techniques for proving them, using reverse mathematics. Interactive activities include teaching an undergraduate course at the introductory level where it is crucial that role models be provided. Dr. Goldsmith will also participate in complexity theory and logic seminars and will continue her participation in the Northeastern Set Theory Seminar.

      "a9003063 SES $40000 Dr. Dinsmore, a professor of anatomy at Rush Medical College, is undertaking a training/study and research program under the guidance of Dr. Robert J. Richards in the Program of History and Philosophy of Science at the University of Chicago. He is also working with Dr. Frederick Churchill of Indiana University. During the course of this professional development award, Dr. Dinsmore is gaining familiarity with and experience in the methods and materials of the history of science and acquiring the skills in doing research in this area. The research component of this award is directed towards examining the transformation of zoology from an observational to a controlled experimental science. Dr. Dinsmore hypothesizes that this transformation occurred in the 18th century and centered on the issue of animal regeneration studies. Dr. Dinsmore has found that from the start of these regeneration studies, the simplicity of experimental execution allowed virtually anyone to repeat the observations; the network of correspondence assured that the discovery of animal regeneration would be broadcast widely and that the experiments would be replicated with varying results and interpretations; and the novelty of the results would attract wide attention from a broad range of the educated public. Dr. Dinsmore is investigating how these circumstances helped to transform what had typically been an examination of \"curiosities of nature\" into a systematic science. He is carrying this research out at the University of Chicago, at Indiana University and at the Bibliotheque Publique et Universitaire in Geneva Switzerland.\n",

In particular he will study certain bundles and sheaves which are associated to the local index which he invented as well as finer invariants. He will also study the geometric meaning of the principal function, an extension of the index which is also defined on the essential spectrum. Professor Pincus' research is in the general area of the theory of operators on Hilbert space. These operators are essentially infinite matrices of complex numbers. Such operators or linear transformations have applications in every area of applied science as well as in pure mathematics. This type of research is an attempt to classify certain important categories of such objects.\n",

      "a9003074 SES $25922 This project investigates how legislatures determine outcomes - -the level of the budget or the toughness of an environmental law, for example. There are two basic views on this question. The first states that the majority rules: a coalition develops that can pass what it favors. The second view argues that legislators compromise among themselves to find a result that maximizes the net benefits to the legislators as a whole. The two perspectives have very different implications for American politics. Under the first, a small majority could take advantage of the minority by passing something that greatly harmed them - - or their constituents. Parties and coalitions should be extremely important, as they determine \"who will win.\" Under the second view, compromise occurs based on each legislator's view of the relative importance of the issue, and ideology is not important. It is also possible that in reality both views have some validity. In this research investigation the first task is to describe the views precisely and formally, to be clear on just what each assumes and what each implies. This work leads to the second major task of the research: testing which of these views is more empirically accurate. For this purpose the investigator uses a \"comparative statics\" approach - - showing how some specific change in underlying conditions implies a change in outcomes. For example, a change in the number of Democratic Senators may have an effect on the defense budget, other things held constant. The size of these effects can then be tested empirically. But, most interesting, sometimes the two views have very different conclusions about what will happen. When the\"status quo\" changes, for instance, the majority rule view often predicts that a bill will replace the \"status quo\" with a different final outcome from the one originally preferred - - even though preferences have not changed. In contrast, the compromise view invariably predicts a change back to the originally preferred outcome. The different views can be most easily tested on experimental data collected previously to test other theories of how committees function. These data are a \"gold-mine\" of results where the preferences of the \"legislators\" are known, and the outcomes are known. Preliminary investigation has found several cases in which comparative statics results support the compromise view. There are also several cases in which the results contradict all current theories; this may lead to better theories in the future. Finally, the different views can be tested on Congressional roll-call data. The researcher has chosen to focus on one policy issue of the late 1970s, which provides a considerable number of roll call votes over several Congresses. The different theories predict that as members of Congress are replaced, the outcome will change - - in different ways. Therefore, this will permit a fairly direct test of the two views of legislatures. If no unexpected difficulties arise, this method would allow investigators to see how responsive the Congress is to changes in the views of the public - shown by changes in members of Congress at election time.\n",
      "a9003075 DMS $47252 Professor Gootman will continue his investigations concerning the ideal structure, representation theory, and dual topology of crossed product C*-algebras GxA determined by an action or coaction of a locally compact G on a C*-algebra A. As in the past, Professor Gootman will combine the three major methods for the study of such algebras: non-commutative duality theory, representation theory, and spectral methods (non-abelian harmonic analysis). Following such an approach, the proposer has already made progress on similar questions in collaboration with Professor Aldo Lazar. Professor Gootman will attempt to generalize a spectral characterization of simplicity of GxA which came out of this collaboration to general amenable G, and also to extend his investigations concerning the duality between induction and restriction of representations. This study should yield new information on ordinary crossed products, and in turn on groups, historically one of the major motivations for studying crossed products. The notion of a C* algebra is an abstraction of the idea of a family of linear transformations on a space. These transformations can also be thought of as having values in the states of the space, and the property of this family which is responsible for the symbol * is the fact that the algebra is generated by transformations whose values in these states are real numbers. The fact that these objects appear naturally in many branches of mathematics and physics makes them important to study.\n",
      "a9003076 CCR $194234 Refined Languages (Refined Fortran, Refined C, etc.) are extensions of their parent languages in which it is possible to express parallelism, but impossible to create races. Where strictly deterministic behavior is desired, multiple executions of a Refined Fortran program with the same input data can be guaranteed to either compute the same results or terminate with the same run-time errors regardless of differences in scheduling. Where asynchronous behavior is desired, freedom from races can be guaranteed. The Refined Languages approach achieves its goal by extending sequential imperative programming languages with data- (rather than control-) oriented terms. Specification of Refined ANSI Fortran `77, and construction of an interprocedural Fortran `77 code analysis tool are complete. This award is to modify the specification to Fortran `8X, extend the analysis tool into a Refined Fortran `8X compiler, and exploit the special features of Refined Languages to construct a Refined Fortran `8X symbolic debugger. Formal study of the comparative expressive powers of control-oriented parallel imperative languages and data- oriented parallel imperative languages will ensue.\n",
      "a9003079 DEB $274603 Interspecific, environmental and development differences in biotic and chemical defense systems of myrmecophytic Cecropia trees will be studied in relation to plant associations with herbivores and symbotic ants in Amazonian rain forest. Seedlings of six Cecropia species will be grown from seed under high and low light regimes in temperate greenhouse and transplant gardens in southeastern Peru'. Ant attracting traits, leaf tannin concentrations, and toughness will be monitored in relation to plant performance, especially growth rates and leaf lifetimes (thought to determine the pattern of investment in chemical and ant-defense). Performance data on transplanted seedlings with and without herbivores will test specific hypotheses for habitat specificity in these trees. Short-term experiments with cultivated seedlings will test for 1) habitat and host specificity in four specialized symbiotic ants; 2) rates of host resource supply to ants as a determinant of the species composition of symbiotic relationships: 3) habitat and species specificity in effects of different ants on herbivory rates, host performances, and colony growth and reproduction. Natural seedling populations are used to investigate species specificity in host choice by queens and host mechanisms for excluding certain ants. Results of studies will be synthesized to test hypotheses that: plant resource environments determine predictable patterns of investment in alternative defense systems and patterns of defense investment determine the species composition of ant-plant associations. Findings will contribute to basic ecological science and will also add to the knowledge base on the biodiversity of tropical forests. //\n",

However, not many statisticians are aware of the problems in astronomy where statistics plays an important role, such as luminosity functions and nondetections, galaxy clustering and image analysis. This conference will bridge the gap between the two communities, exposing researchers and students of the two communities to the common problems of the two fields.

Hopp of Northwestern University in order to examine the origins, development and diffusion of operations research (OR) from 1940- 1960. OR is a mathematical approach to complex problem solving created during World War II. A study of Allied scientific-military cooperation in developing and employing OR reveals its military importance. The postwar era (to 1960) shows how OR methods were extended to create mathematical programming, game theory, and other cornerstones of decision science. Dr. Hay will examine this postwar technology transfer from solely military use to private and public enterprize. He will employ American and British government archives, memoirs, official histories, other relevant monographs and articles. He will also interview key surviving OR practitioners.\n",
      "a9003087 IIS $218741 When humans use language, they show an essential responsiveness to their hearers. When language is automatically generated, it is similarly necessary to ensure that language is appropriate for its intended audience. Much previous research in computational linguistics has focused on building user models and selecting information from a knowledge base to present to the user. It is important, however, that the phrasing of a text be also tailored to the hearer - otherwise it may be just as ineffective as texts which rely on knowledge the hearer does not have. The realization that situations systematically affect language can greatly help the tailoring process: given appropriate classifications of situation-types, the consequences of these situations on language can be specified, and suitable language can be produced. In a pilot study that involved generating explanations for an expert system tailored to three user types, previous work has shown that is is possible to specify the type of language required in a given situation and to build a text planning system that uses that specification to control phrasing of its text. This research will extend that work. The goal is to create a framework within which it is possible to gain systematic control over phrasing by designing methodologies and mechanisms by which the systematic relationship between situations and language can be found, represented, and used to tailor generated texts.\n",
      "a9003093 ECS $66000 One of the major challenges in computational mechanics is the development of numerical methods for resolving the structure of functions with high gradients in complicated geometries. In problems such as material failure due to localization and crack propagation, or shocks in fluid dynamics, the regions of high gradients are of several orders of magnitude smaller than the size of the domain of interest. Therefore, if a uniform finite element mesh is used, a tremendous amount of elements would be needed to accurately resolve the structure of high gradients. The purpose of this research is to improve the quality of finite element calculations in the regions of high gradients. This is accomplished by superimposing a patch of higher order hierarchical elements on the portion of the original finite element mesh where resolution is required. Continuity of the displacement field is maintained by imposing homogenous boundaries between the original and superimposed fields. The superimposed and the original mesh topology. The research to be carried out as part of this project will consider the following aspects: 1. The development and implementation of the finite element mesh superposition method. 2. Automation of the superposition method. High resolution of the fields will be obtained by controlling the location of the superimposed field, its subdivision and the polynomial order of the superimposed elements. The process of selection of these variables will be steered by a posteriori information. Pointwise error and the superimposed mesh will be designed to make a nearly optimal use of posterior information.\n",
      "a9003094 ATM $189100 A theoretical framework to calculate pressure-broadened halfwidths with an uncertainty of ~ 5% for atmospherically important species will be developed. Calculations are also expected to yield pressure-induced line shifts. Two approaches to computing the halfwidth and line shift for water vapor perturbed by nitrogen or oxygen will be compared with experimental measurements, and the method that results in the best agreement will be used to generate a database for atmospherically important transitions of water vapor. Next, the calculations will be extended to methane perturbed by nitrogen or oxygen. The research is motivated by the need for increased confidence in remote sensing measurements and a better determination of the radiative forcings of greenhouse gases. This investigation will lay the foundation for further calculations of halfwidths and line shifts for other atmospheric species.\n",
      "a9003095 DMS $38654 This project is concerned with problems in two subareas of mathematical analysis: partial differential equations and harmonic analysis related to the Gaussian measure. The project has two objectives. The first is to analyze the behavior of solutions of a class of degenerate parabolic equations in divergence form with non-smooth coefficients. Such coefficients may be zero, infinite or both. The equations are known to model cases of diffusion of temperature in a non-homogeneous and non-isotropic material. Basic questions to be considered in this work include finding conditions which imply regularity of solutions, determining whether a Harnack principle is valid for non-negative solutions and understanding the behavior of the fundamental solutions of the equations. Weighted norm inequalities of the Poincare and Sobolev type will be used in this study. The second objective concerns the behavior, in the space of functions integrable with respect to Gaussian measure, of a class of transforms generated by the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup. These transforms play the role, in the Gaussian context, of the classical singular integrals of M. Riesz. Of particular interest will be the establishment of weak-type estimates with constants bounded independently of dimension. This investigation will center on the use of a maximal function as in the Calderon- Zygmund theory, but this function does not inherit all the properties of the classical maximal functions. However, there is evidence to suggest that it is still of weak type with respect to Gaussian measure. This is the first problem to be resolved.\n",
      "a9003100 DBI $155120 This award will provide funds to a group of scientists who direct microchemical facilities that serve large numbers of investigators at their own and other institutions. The funds will be used to obtain and distribute synthetic peptides useful for measuring the sensitivity and accuracy of protein sequencing procedures at these and many similar facilities, and to increase cooperation and contact between such facilities. The overall aim of the project is to increase the quality of service provided by the facilities. The use of microchemical techniques for the sequencing and synthesis of protein and DNA now occupies an important role in modern biology. Because of the substantial investment in equipment and personnel required, such work is most often performed in central facilities that serve a large group of investigators. There are now over a hundred such facilities in the U.S. This award will help insure that the service provided by each is of a uniform high quality and is consistent with the state of the art in protein sequencing.\n",

The second of these is the similarities between these same polynomials and Axiom A diffeomorphism.

      "a9003108 EAR $110013 Chemical sediments dominated by iron(III) oxides are a manifestation of the unique combination of abundant free oxygen and liquid water found in the surface and many near-surface environments of Earth. Research performed in this laboratory has shown that the stable isotope ratios of oxygen, hydrogen and carbon in certain iron(III) oxides contain information on ancient temperatures, sources of water and organic contributions to aqueous carbonate systems associated with iron(III) oxide precipitation. In addition trapped CO2 abundance data from geothites may be related to ambient CO2 partial pressures at the time of mineral formation. The oxygen isotope systematics of ubiquitous phosphate-iron(III) oxide pairs will be studied to determine if they contain information on paleotemperatures. Knowledge obtained from this and our previous studies of iron(III) oxides will be applied to isotopic, chemical and attendant petrographic investigations of Phanerozoic oolitic ironstones, recent bacterially mediated iron(III) oxide precipitate and Late Precambrian banded iron formation(BIF). Fe(III) carbonate abundance and carbon-13 variations in a Late Ordovician weathering surface could provide knowledge of ambient CO2 partial pressures and the role of organic matter in this ancient environment. Oxygen, hydrogen and carbon abundance and isotopic data from tropical oolitic ironstones that date from global \"greenhouse\" and \"icehouse\" intervals in the Phanerozoic will be obtained. The ancient tropical temperatures and sources of water will be compared for the deposits that represent these putative global climatic extremes. Oxygen isotopic measurements of a Late Precambrian quartz-hematite BIF should provide insight into the depositional environment of this deposit. Paleoclimatic data of the type to be obtained in this research are essential to an ultimate understanding of the possible link between global tectonics and the types of climatic regimes that could produce apparent tropical continental ice sheets in the Late Precambrian or polar ice sheets in the Late Ordovician.\n",
      "a9003109 DMS $80350 This award supports the research in automorphic forms of Professor Steven Kudla of the University of Maryland at College Park. Dr. Kudla's project is to work on two problems involving theta functions, L-functions, and arithmetic. The first of these problems concerns a conjecture about the identification of the first two terms in the Laurent expansion of the Siegel Eisenstein series at certain special points. The second is concerned with an analogue for the triple L-function of the result of Gross and Zagier that relates the derivative of the standard L-function of a holomorphic cusp form on GL(2) to the height pairing of Heegner points on the Jacobian of the modular curve. Non-Euclidean plane geometry began in the early nineteenth century as a mathematical curiosity, but by the end of that century, mathematicians had realized that many objects of fundamental importance are non-Euclidean in their basic nature. The detailed study of non-Euclidean plane geometries has given rise to several branches of modern mathematics, of which the study of modular and automorphic forms is one of the most active. This field is principally concerned with questions about the whole numbers, but in its use of geometry and analysis, it retains connection to its historical roots.\n",
      "a9003110 IIS $116571 The goal of this research is development of a new database to aid researchers in automatic recognition of continuous speech. Dr. Cole will conduct controlled experiments to determine the effect of phonetic context on human recognition of speech excerpts. Initial studies will make use of phonetically labeled excerpts from the widely used TIMIT speech database. Human phonetic recognition will be measured with varying retention of preceding and following phonetic cues. Dr. Cole will also attempt to design neural-network classification algorithms that match human phonetic classification performance.\n",
      "a9003111 BCS $8580 This dissertation research grant will support an anthropology graduate student investigating peasant responses to state divestment and reprivatization of the Mexican sugar industry. The Mexican state recently sold the majority of its sugar mills to national and transnational corporations, thus weakening the relationship between the cane producers unions and the state. The research will examine how this divestment affects local peasant producers. Hypotheses to be tested are that credit will be distributed more unevenly, socioeconomic differentiation will increase in general, local level decision making over production will decrease, and that the state will mediate between unions and mill owners. Methods include a census of one village, participant observation of producers, unions, and mills, structured interviews, oral histories, archival data. This research is important because it will help us understand the strategies rural producers adopt in the face of changes in corporate ownership of economic institutions. This knowledge is critical to the resolution of political unrest attendant on increased societal problems associated with debt restructuring in the Third World.\n",
      "a9003114 DMR $366000 The research is a renewal of a highly productive grant at Northwestern University (DMR-8701167). During the three years of support by the National Science Foundation two students were awarded the doctorate degree, one received the masters degree, and three students are in various stages of the doctorate degree. Seven papers were accepted for publication in refereed scientific journals, and seven more are in process. The research during that period emphasized the following: (1) transition and rare earth metals as electronically active defects in compound semiconductors, (2) flow modulation epitaxy of indium phosphide and its alloys, (3) defects in indium phosphide based heterostructures. The current research studies deep level defects in deliberately doped epitaxial indium phosphide and its alloys prepared by atmospheric pressure organometallic vapor phase epitaxy. A number of defect phenomena are being emphasized, for example, compensation mechanisms in heavily doped material, deep donor levels associated with substitutional impurities, deep levels in quantum wells and superlattices, and rare earth related impurities. The materials are being characterized using photoluminescence, photoconductivity, and deep level transient spectroscopy.\n",
      "a9003124 HRD $160000 It is recognized that abiotic \"stress\" or damage and insect and disease attack on plants can change their subsequent resistance to insects and diseases. However, there is little consensus on whether stress and damage have the same effects; whether abiotic and biotic perturbations have the same effects; whether insects and diseases produce the same effects; whether overall resistance increases or decreases; and what the mechanisms and evolutionary implications are. In this research, an integrated approach will be taken using experiments with a model system--cottonwood, a beetle, an aphid, and rust and leaf-spot fungi--in order to determine if stress/damage caused by different insects or diseases results in consistent patterns of plant physical and chemical characteristics and insect and disease performance. By comparing these results with data on chemical and resistance changes due to abiotic ozone induced stress, the overall patterns of physical, chemical and biotic changes can be elucidated, which mechanisms may be responsible can be infered, and the implications to the evolution of plant defense can be deduced. An understanding of how a plant responds to damage and stress due to ozone as well as insect herbivory and pathogen-caused disease allows us to predict the consequences of pollution on plant growth and mortality. These findings have direct implications to issues in agriculture and forestry on the consequences of air pollution, ozone, and acid rain on crop yield and forest vigor. Dr. Krischik will teach a topic seminar in plant-insect-microbial interactions and be a panel member in a full-day forum on \"Opportunities in Ecology.\" Through the IES Education Program, she will visit area schools and encourage young women to pursue careers in science and teach in a \"Workshop for School Science Teachers.\" Dr. Krischik will also lecture in the ecology courses offered at nearby Vassar College. This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering by providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers employed in industry, government, and academic institutions. By encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a valuable investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.\n",
      "a9003126 HRD $106732 This project consists of two independent parts. The first part arises from Dr. Li's recent constructions of Ramanujan graphs and graphs with small eigenvalues using Deligne's estimate of generalized Kloosterman sums and using the Riemann hypothesis for curves over finite fields. Such graphs have wide applications and all the known constructions are number-theoretic. Continuing the theme of her work, she proposes to obtain estimates of interesting exponential sums from the Riemann hypothesis and Weil conjectures, to study which Ramanujan graphs she constructed come from the quotient of the tree attached to PGL2 by arithmetic discrete subgroups, and to construct other Ramanujan graphs using number theory. The second part is in representation theory. It concerns proving Tunnell's multiplicity formula for representations of a local quaternion group using the formula for the reduced traces expressed in terms of the associated y- factors and understanding the role of the y-factors attached to degree two irreducible representations of local Weil groups. The information will enhance the understanding of how the y-factors determine the classes of representations. In addition, Dr. Li will teach an advanced graduate course entitled \"General Reciprocity Laws,\" and she will present several seminar talks in number theory, representation theory and combinatorics. This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering by providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.

      "a9003129 HRD $77137 A novel pH-dependent locus ina, mapping at 48.5 min, has been isolated through lacZ operon fusions in Escherichia coli. This locus exhibits pH-dependent induction by membrane-permeable weak acids and by protonophores, but not by external acidification alone. These data could be explained by the detection of internal acidification by ina. The ina fusions will be cloned and sequenced, and the sequence analyzed for promoters and regulatory sites. Acid-sensitivity of the regulatory DNA will be tested by in vitro transcription of the cloned fusions. The possible regulatory role of H-palindromes, which produce H-form DNA at low pH, will be investigated. Regulator genes for ina will be isolated, by screening Tn10 insertions and ethylmethanesulfonate mutants for isolates which are either constitutive or uninducible. Interactive activities include teaching a course in molecular biology, presenting a public lecture on the topic of women and science, and forming a support group for young scientists attempting to balance competitive research careers with family life. This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering by providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.

      "a9003132 HRD $125528 This project will involve the preparation of a graduate level text that will introduce concepts and techniques of stochastic modeling and statistical analysis in the contexts of ocean and atmospheric sciences. The text, which will be based in part on lecture notes prepared by the late R. Preisendorfer during his tenure at the Naval Postgraduate School in the G. Haltnier Research Chair, will fill an important gap in current scientific literature. The concepts and techniques that will be presented in the language and research settings of two allied geophysical sciences, provide basic tools for diagnosis, analysis and prediction of dynamical systems. Their presentation in this form will make them, and their relationships with the evaluation of hypotheses, more accessible in scientific terms. Interactive activities include seminars on subjects of Dr. Thiebaux's previous research, teaching two graduate level courses, organization of a workshop on professional careers in physical and mathematical sciences, and interactions with faculty and students in their customary university meetings. The courses and the discussions following seminars will complement the research component of the academic visit, while they provide open opportunities for interactions with students at a critical stage in the formation of their personal professional expectations. Finally, the workshop will provide a concrete look at career opportunities, with the inspiration of women who achieved major goals. This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering by providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.

      "a9003137 HRD $82836 This project will investigate (i) the acoustic correlates of the segment, syllable, and mora in Icelandic, (ii) the mora timing hypothesis and the segment timing hypothesis, via the contrasting stress, syllable and rhythm systems in Icelandic, English and Spanish, and (iii) the effects on timing due to within word position and position with higher syntactic and prosodic structures. The goal is to explore the relationship between phonological and phonetic components of language and to determine the nature of the timing systems controlling different prosodic constituents. The interactive component includes research seminar and colloquia, participation in ongoing faculty workshop and lab meetings, and two courses. The two courses are a graduate research seminar on \"Rhythm, Timing and Prosodic Structure\" and an undergraduate lecture and lab course on \"Linguistics, Law and Science.\" This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering by providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.

      "a9003139 HRD $110027 This project compares the contrasting careers and personal lives of two great 20th Century British women scientists, one a theoretician and the other an experimentalist, and seeks to clarify the social and scientific determinants of success and of failure for women in science. The lives and works of these two women intersected in the 1930s, when both were based at Oxford, while further belonging to a group of a dozen ideologically sensitive scientists who pioneered the rise of molecular biology in Britain. The case study of Dorothy C. Hodgkin (1910-), sole recipient of the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1964, will be explored as a paradigm of success, including the establishment of a research school composed of over a hundred men and women disciples. The case study of Dorothy Wrinch (1894-1976), a mathematician turned biologist who had been considered a \"woman Einstein,\" but who came to spend the later part of her career obsessed with a theory which her men rivals erroneously claimed to have refuted, will be explored as a paradigm of failure. The project seeks to exhibit and clarify the diversity of women's experience in science in its historical, scientific, and political contexts. The interactive component of this project includes: a) teaching a new course \"Social history of women scientists from the French revolution to the present\" for both graduate and undergraduate students; b) the organization of an interdisciplinary and international symposium on \"Women's lives in science: Historical and contemporary perspectives,\" at which historians, sociologists and practicing scientists will present their experiences; c) teaching a new seminar on \"Research schools of molecular biology in the US, UK and France, 1920-1970\"; d) the organization of a monthly colloquium to stimulate interaction between the scientific, historical and literary communities, especially students, at the host institution. This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering by providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.

      "a9003142 HRD $107585 Science is a problem-solving activity. This project will explore strategies for solving problems, especially strategies for forming, testing and revising hypotheses. In previous work, strategies exemplified in a historical case were analyzed, including strategies for resolving anomalies for a theory and for producing an improved version of the theory. This project will test the sufficiency of such strategies in a computer model, using techniques from artificial intelligence. The model will provide a method for representing a biological theory (Mendelian genetics) and will incorporate reasoning strategies to model changes in that theory. Experiments with alternative reasoning strategies will be explored with the model. The completion of this project will contribute to the growing body of knowledge about computational methods for representing scientific theories and reasoning about such theories. Interactive activities include teaching a graduate course on computational philosophy of science, giving two departmental colloquia presentations, and, with support from the Cognitive Science Center, organizing a symposium on Career Opportunities for Women in Cognitive Science. This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering by providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.

      "a9003149 DMS $42300 Several problems in the field of differential equations will be under investigation during the term of this project. They concern systems of differential equations from the physical sciences, namely Lagrangian equations representing forced motion of a mechanical system and the more general Hamiltonian systems. A system of forced pendulums would give rise to the first class of equations, whereas the motion of bodies under gravitational forces often uses the Hamiltonian structure. The Lagrangian equations involved in this study have periodic coefficients and forcing functions. It is natural to inquire whether of not there will exist periodic solutions under such assumptions. As with many equations modeling phenomena from the physical world, the Lagrangians result from a principle of energy or action minimization. One seeks to find critical points of a certain integral with admissible functions taken from a Hilbert space. Depending on the growth of the potential, there may be many distinct periodic solutions, whereas evidence suggests that for periodic potentials, only finitely many periodic solutions may exist. A measure of the number of such solutions in terms the structure of the potential will be sought. Work on Hamiltonian systems will follow a similar vein concentrating on the case of periodic Hamiltonians. Solutions of these systems are known as subharmonics. There are known to be periodic subharmonics under very general conditions. The most important subharmonics are those with minimal periods. This research will look for a description of solutions with minimal periods in cases where additional symmetry assumptions are made on the Hamiltonian. Solutions of Hamiltonian systems must lie on surfaces of constant energy. A related goal of this work will be to determine which surfaces of the Hamiltonian carry a periodic orbit.\n",
      "a9003150 SES $54010 This proposed research program focuses on the relationship between race, class, and public opinion. It addresses the issues of black intragroup cohesiveness and black/white differences in general attitudes and values. The first phase examines the general attitudes, values, and opinions expressed by black Americans and the extent to which class cleavages can account for any existing intraracial differences. The second phase will explore interracial differences (black/white) focusing on class- based explanations. Data come from the NSF-supported General Social Surveys from 1982 and 1987. The PI will contrast Myrdal's thesis that blacks lack intragroup diversity with Wilson's contention that emerging class cleavages among blacks and the increasing social isolation of lower class blacks have spawned measurable intraracial differences on a variety of attitudes and opinions.\n",
      "a9003151 DMR $77000 This research program involves the study of glasses, primarily through the use of nuclear magnetic resonance. The proposed research is in several different areas. One area is a collaboration (S.W. Martin, Iowa State) on 29Si magic angle sample spinning NMR on alkali borosilicate glasses over an extremely wide range of compositions. A second area is an continuation of studies with P. Bray (Brown) on the 10B and 11B nuclear quadrupole resonance properties of alkali borate glasses. Further studies will also be made of extremely high alkali content alkali borate glasses with the emphasis on exploring the relationship between structure and physical properties. A new collaboration with Kamitsos (National Hellenic Research Foundation, Athens) on joint infrared and Raman spectroscopic studies of very high alkali contnet borate glasses will be initiated.\n",
      "a9003154 SES $40000 This two year, half-time award enables a legal scholar and ethicist at the Institute for Philosophy and Public Policy at the University of Maryland College Park to develop his understanding of theory and research underlying the forensic applications of DNA typing. He will undertake a two-year course of study with the Division of Human Genetics at the University of Maryland at Baltimore, sponsored by Dr. Maimon Cohen, Director of the Division, and Dr. Joann Boughman, Director of Graduate Studies. Under their supervision, he will receive intensive training in molecular and population genetics and DNA typing through classroom instruction and laboratory rotations. He will use this training in a program of collaborative research with colleagues at the Institute for Philosophy and Public Policy and specialists in the forensic applications of genetic typing. He expects to complete several articles during the grant period, to be submitted to journals in law, public policy and criminology, and to begin work on a book. This project addresses a central issue in ethics and values studies: the social values and mutual obligations and responsibilities that arise in the interactions between new developments in science and technology, and society. The investigator and his host specialists and host institution are uniquely well-qualified to undertake and support this project; research and related activities are likely to continue after the period of the award. Results are likely to be appropriately disseminated and useful. An award in the amount of $40,000 is therefore recommended.\n",
      "a9003157 INT $17298 This award will support Drs. David Chih-yuen Koo, Joseph S. Miller, and Lloyd B. Robinson of the University of California Lick Observatory in a research collaboration with Dr. Gustavo Bruzual of the Centro de Investigaciones de Astronomia (CIDA) in Merida, Venezuela. The purpose of the collaboration is to establish a long-term joint program involving two parts: the first involves travel and data-transfer support for a pilot instrumentation project to develop a large-format electronic (CCD) camera for use on the new CIDA 1-meter Schmidt telescope. Lick and CIDA astronomers will then use this powerful combination to undertake various extensive new photometric and synoptic surveys of joint scientific interest. One of these will be a major new long-term observational survey of 20 areas in the sky. Among many potential programs using these data will be a multicolor photometric survey to study the luminosity function of galaxies and a synoptic program to search for very distant supernovae. The second part of the collaboration will attempt to develop new quantitative methods of analyzing extensive multidimensional data, aimed mainly at exploring the evolution of galaxies and cosmology. Major observational surveys are some of the most productive astronomical tools to understand the universe. Such surveys allow astronomers to measure distributions of properties of known objects and also to discover new, rare, or unusual classes of objects. Despite their importance, photometric surveys that cover large areas, synoptic programs, or any long-term projects are all particularly difficult to undertake in today's climate of scarce telescope time. The CIDA observatory in Venezuela has recently finished the construction of a 1-meter Schmidt telescope that has overall optical properties similar to the one at Palomar and is the among the three largest in the northern hemisphere. The collaborators' plan to develop imaging cameras for the telescope at CIDA using charge coupled detectors (CCDs) of very large format developed at the Detector Laboratory at Lick, plus the ability of CIDA to provide dedicated observers time for long-term surveys should allow astronomers to undertake a variety of new surveys of unprecedented depth, time and areal coverage.\n",
      "a9003158 AST $65785 This project, by a group of outstanding young observational astronomers, aims at an understanding of the properties of ex- tremely faint galaxies. These objects dominate the universe in terms of numbers, although their contribution to the total mass is poorly known. Indeed, most of our knowledge of star formation in external galaxies, and of galaxy properties in general has come from studies of systems which may not be typical. These workers will explore the properties of these much more numerous objects by both optical and radio means. Preliminary work by these investigators has already resulted in the discovery of the two largest, most gas-rich spiral galaxies known, both systems of very low surface brightness.\n",
      "a9003159 CHE $187600 Dr. John R. Bleeke of Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program to continue studies on pentadienyl-metal-phosphine complexes. Bleeke has developed a route to prepare metallabenzenes from pentadienyl-metal precursors and plans to prepare numerous compounds of this type. This will enable detailed studies of these novel compounds, including investigation of ring substitution reactions, ring insertion reactions, and coordination of the metallabenzenes to other metal centers. In addition, Bleeke will attempt to use pentadienyl-metal- phosphine complexes to activate C-H and N-H bonds. Addition of more than one substrate molecule to the metal may be possible if ring slippage of cyclopentadiene occurs. In a third project, nucleophilic attack at the internal carbons of bound pentadienyl groups to produce optically active products will be investigated. The results promise to be of fundamental interest and are relevant to some selective catalytic processes.\n",
      "a9003161 CCR $210626 A fault-tolerant, distributed program is a program that can continue executing despite processor and network failures. The general goal of this research is to develop techniques and support systems that facilitate the design, construction, and verification of this type of software. To accomplish this goal, a number of topics will be investigated in areas ranging from communication protocols to formal verification. In particular: operating system support for fault-tolerant, distributed programming; programming language abstractions that facilitate construction of fault-tolerant, distributed systems; extension of existing software engineering techniques and programming environments to encompass fault-tolerant programming; and verification of fault-tolerant programs will be studied. The first, second, and fourth topics represent the continuation of investigations currently underway and natural extensions in those areas, while the third is a new initiative. Since fault-tolerance is difficult to study in isolation, this work is based largely on existing systems and languages, including the SR distributed programming language, the Psync interprocess communication mechanism, and the Software Designer's Associate project. This approach also facilitates immediate progress on research issues by eliminating the need to construct necessary infrastructure.\n",
      "a9003165 IIS $270791 Theories of defeasible reasoning previously developed and supported will be further investigated. Expansion will include networks with expressive enhancements such as: nets with limited cyclicity; Boolean combinations of nodes in nets; study of arguments which interfere with a given argument by disabling inferences leading to a particular conclusion; hydra inheritance; higher order links; semantic foundations for defeasible inheritance; and additional work on roles and relations. This is basic research on reasoning focusing on inheritance and having significance in non-monotonic methods.\n",
      "a9003176 DMS $27750 This research involves the study of fitting statistical nonlinear regression models to data for which the response variance has been modeled as a function of the mean response and other variables and possible unknown parameters which must be estimated from the data. Estimation will be studied for repeated measures data in which the response variance varies within individuals. A heteroscedastic random coefficient model containing a functional model for intra-individual variance with unknown parameters to be estimated is considered. Systematic study of the implications of the theory of variance function estimation for data consisting of independent observations will be conducted. Estimation for regression analysis with censored data will be studied when a variance function model is postulated. These models are applied to a detection limit problem common in pharmaceutical applications.\n",

Phase transition measurements will be used to determine the critical exponents of the films. This group is working to modify the physical properties of matter that affect the magnetic behavior of materials through a study of the relation between atomic level structure and magnetism. The instrument being developed will combine two complementary spin-sensitive spectroscopic techniques (Kerr effect and spin-polarized secondary electron emission) with MBE and thin film structure analysis capabilities (spot-profile analysis LEED and electron forward scattering spectroscopy). Scanning tunneling microscopy carried out on a separate system will be used to characterize the substrates.\n",
      "a9003186 ATM $390000 The atmospheric chemistry and gas-to-particle conversion phenomena of biogenic hydrocarbon systems will be investigated in this research project. The goals of the research are to elucidate the gas-phase photooxidation pathways of key biogenic hydrocarbons, to identify the aerosol-forming capability of these hydrocarbons, to further understanding of gas-to-particle conversion phenomena in atmospheric organic systems, and to evaluate the applicability of nucleation theories to atmospheric species. Outdoor smog chamber experiments will be conducted with isoprene/NOx and beta pinene/NOx mixture over a spectrum of concentration levels. Quantities to be measured include hydrocarbon, O3, NO, NO2 concentrations, aerosol size distributions by differential mobility analyzer, optical particle counter and epiphianiometer, and aerosol molecular composition by GC/MS and FTIR analyses. Aerosol species identified will be studied for nucleation either as single component or binary, with water. Theoretical work will continue on the development of a kinetic theory of nucleation. Analysis of the experimental data will involve a description of gas-phase chemical reaction mechanisms, including the generation of condensable species, the nucleation of these species, either homomolecular or binary, and the diffusion of these and additional species to particles.\n",
      "a9003192 CHE $215500 This research is being funded by the Organic Synthesis Chemistry Program. New techniques for the synthesis of naturally occurring medium or long chain peptides are being developed which will make them rapidly available in multi-gram quantities for testing purposes. New synthetic techniques based on base- and solvent-sensitive amino-protecting groups promise to make available quickly multi-gram quantities of shorter peptides and to markedly improve the synthesis of small quantities of longer peptides. Methods for the synthesis of long peptide chains of 100 or more amino acid units which involve the coupling of segments enjoy significant advantages over those involving stepwise approaches. Three methods for assembling the appropriate segments will be studied: (a) the FMOC/Polyamine solution technique, (b) the two polymer (\"inverse merrifield\") approach and (c) the standard Merrifield solid phase method. In all three approaches the applicability of newly-discovered FMOC amino acid fluorides as rapid-acting, inexpensive coupling agents will be studied. Such reagents are now available for all but four of the common amino acids. Synthesis of appropriate acid fluoride reagents for these four compounds (Arg, Asn, Gln, His) will be developed. To facilitate solid phase syntheses two special resin supports will be investigated: (a) tertiary alcohol resins which should completely inhibit loss of peptide from the resin due to diketopiperazine formation at the depeptide stage, especially in the case of C-terminal or penultimate proline or glycine and (b) resin supports bearing tertiary aminoalcohol functions which should serve to catalyse loading of the first amino acid and thereby promote complete on-line automated syntheses from the first to the last amino acid. Once rapid, routine methods for the synthesis of protected segments are available, both solution and solid phase methods of segment coupling will be examined. A novel method of effecting racemization-free segment coupling involving protection of the C-terminal amide bond by FM-bar or a related amide protectant will be pursued. The model chosen to study the application of these techniques is a 19-unit segment of a silkworm prothoracicotropic hormone, PTTH-II-(1-19).\n",
      "a9003193 MCB $120000 The broad objective is to understand how organims can manipulate their DNA. The model system is hypotrichous ciliated protozoa, which manipulate their DNA extensively during development of the macronucleus from a micronucleus after cell mating. During macornuclear development all genes are excised from the chromosomes and exist in the mature macronucleus as 20,000 different and separate DNA molecules ranging in size from 400 pairs (bp) to 12,000 bp. An example of cutting and joining of DNA is the chromosomal actin gene, which contains nine exons in the order 1- 2-4-5-6-7-8-9 separated by eight intronlike sequences. The intronlike sequences are eliminated and the nine exons are rearranged and joined in the order 8-7-1-2-4-3-5-9-6. Reordering and removal of intronlike sequences is necessary to yield a functional actin gene. The specific aims are: (1) to identify other genes in which removal of intronlike sequences is accompanied by reordering of exons; (2) to track the temporal order of steps in removal of intronlike sequences and joining of exons in the micronuclear acting gene, followed by telomere addition, during maconuclear development using primarily the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique.\n",
      "a9003194 DMR $185000 This modestly high power dilution refrigerator will be used for studies of spin-polarized quantum systems. This refrigerator will be used in collaborative efforts to study atomic hydrogen with a Lyman-alpha laser, to study and develop a cryogenic hydrogen maser (CHM), to study atomic scattering at low temperatures, and a number of other experiments. The laser experiment is directed at obtaining conditions for Bose-Einstein condensation, which would be of fundamental significance for physics. In addition, the laser provides a valuable diagnostic tool for the study of atoms in magnetic traps. The CHM promises not only to be more stable than any existing oscillator, but by virtue of its stability will enable precise measurements of interaction constants in this fundamental system. Scattering experiments will enable the determination of many very important cross sections never before measured. A number of other experiments promise to yield rich new phenomena.\n",

In particular, he will study vortex methods for incompressible flows, the numerical capturing of oscillatory solutions of gasdynamic equations, and the use of dispersive approximations in the solution of compressible flow problems. Fluid flow problems in two and three space dimensions are governed by complicated systems of nonlinear partial differential equations. Often the only practical way to solve such systems is to use a computer to generate approximate numerical solutions. But this is not all that easy either. The principal investigator will use what is called a vortex method to generate numerical solutions of the equations of incompressible and compressible fluid flow. This basic method and the improvements on it made by the principal investigator allow one to find accurate solutions in an efficient manner.\n",
      "a9003206 DMS $40890 Professor Wallach will continue his research in the general area of group representation theory. In particular his research will involve a generalization of the Kuznetsov formula and the Laplacian on locally symmetric spaces. In addition he will study the asymptotic behavior of Whittaker functionals in the theory of the Toda lattice and further projects in the area of direct integral decompositions of reducible real reductive groups. Group theory is basically the theory of symmetry. To take a simple example, when the system in question is invariant under a change in the position of the origin of space, the group of translations naturally arises. While groups are abstract objects, particular situations demand concrete realizations or \"representations\" of the symmetry group. Professor Wallach's investigations involve representations of groups which have geometrical or physical content.\n",
      "a9003213 DMS $491950 This project is concerned with the admissible representation theory of reductive groups over p-adic fields and, in particular, the various correspondences between the sets of irreducible representations of these groups. The principal investigators will work on the classification of the admissible dual via restriction to certain compact, open subgroups; relations with parabolic induction; and compatibility with Langlands functoriality and Howe's theory of the theta correspondence. This research falls into the broad category of p-adic algebraic groups. Historically, algebraic groups arose in an effort to describe all the transformations or symmetries of an n-dimensional space. The spaces under consideration here, however, are not the familiar real spaces like the line and the plane, but totally disconnected objects that are important in number theory and pure algebra.\n",
      "a9003216 DMS $170520 Studies are proposed which center around the development and testing of new model-based statistical procedures. Included are applied studies in social, biomedical and physical systems whose analysis motivates certain new models and techniques that are tailored to practical problem-solving. The models to be studied gnerally have complex graphical structures, and the related inferences draw on several sources of statistical and expert knowledge. The statistical techniques include Bayesian and belief function methods that are computationally intensive, thus requiring algorithm development and are to be studied in part through assessment of numerical implementations.\n",
      "a9003217 DMS $52250 This project is concerned with problems in cohomology and the representation theory of finite groups. The principal investigator will study Mackey functors, with particular applications to modular representation theory of finite groups and topology; perfect isometries of blocks and derived equivalences; and group actions on complexes. The cohomology of groups, with emphasis on compact Lie groups and groups of finite virtual cohomological dimension, will also be examined. The research supported concerns the representation of finite groups. The structure of the groups is realized through the action of the groups as transformations on spaces. This is currently a very active area of pure algebra.\n",
      "a9003221 DBI $253731 In the vascular systems of the body (blood and lymphatic) it is the smallest muscular vessels that play the greatest role in physiological regulation. It has been extremely difficult in the past to make quantitative studies of the behavior of these vessels because they are too small to allow the attachment of mechanical devices to measure their contractions. It is possible to measure their movement by computer image processing, but this approach has not been exploited because of the previous high cost of the equipment and the lack of suitable software. Now that appropriate computer equipment is no longer prohibitively expensive, we will use a novel algorithm of our design to implement software that will (1) monitor diameter in several separate regions of a vascular tree and (2) monitor diameter change as a function of length along a region of a single vessel. The algorithm we now use can be applied to vessels in isolated preparations that do not contain blood. In response to our own needs and to requests from other groups, we have developed another algorithm for vessels that contain blood, and we shall develop a second set of programs using this algorithm. These systems will advance the technical capabilities in basic research in the fields of blood and lymphatic microcirculation.\n",
      "a9003222 DMS $37288 Professor Gaillard will study the structure of Harish- Chandra modules for semisimple Lie groups. In particular he will study the relationship of the representation algebra and the extension algebra and try to show that they are dual formal algebras in the sense of Beilinson and Ginsburg, a conjecture he has verified already in special cases. This research involves the theory of group representations. Group theory is basically the study of symmetry. To take an example, when the system in question is invariant under a change in the position of the origin of space, the group of translations naturally arises. While groups are abstract objects, particular situations demand concrete realizations or \"representations\" of the symmetry group.\n",
      "a9003223 DMS $136786 This project will involve the study of singularities in the theory of singular integrals and differentiation of integrals, on the d-bar equation on domains of finite type in several complex variables, and on dispersive nonlinear partial differential equations, with emphasis on applications of techniques from harmonic analysis and singular integrals. The five major topics to be studied are (1) the d-bar equation on domains of finite type in several complex variables, (2) singular maximal functions and differentiation of integrals, (3) nonlinear dispersive partial differential equations, (4) singular integrals on sets and analytic capacity, and (5) a question in non-commutative ergodic theory. The research in this project is aimed at the study of partial differential equations and the tools used in their analysis. In particular, it involves the applications of the ideas of harmonic analysis to problems in several complex variables and nonlinear dispersive equations.\n",
      "a9003226 IIS $128846 This grant will support research in several techniques for encoding acoustic-phonetic information to be used in speaker- independent continuous-speech recognition. Time-delay and recursive neural network architectures will be used for spectral analysis of overlapping speech segments, to be compared with a Bayesian maximum-likelihood classification of the speech spectral dynamics. Neural-network outputs will then be encoded as approximate phonetic distances, with a two-level iterative training method to optimize overall recognition. Integration of this system with hidden-Markov speech recognition will also be studied.\n",
      "a9003227 DMS $164000 This proposal concerns itself with several problems involving random media, namely the propagation of pulse waves and the focussing of singularities of solutions of the nonlinear Schroedinger equation. In particular, the principal investigator will study direct and inverse problems for pulse reflection of waves in random media, reflection and transmission of gravity waves in irregular channels, and singular solutions of the Schroedinger equation due to nonlinear focussing of light beams. Such problems arise in a host of areas, for example, seismology, plasma physics and nonlinear optics. Many phenomena involve the propagation of waves through inhomogeneous media. Think of seismic waves travelling inside the earth after an earthquake. Since the medium is not uniform or orderly, we call it random and scientists use a variety of mathematical models to help understand how local microscopic properties influence macroscopic ones. The macroscopic effects are the the ones we can measure and they usually are of most interest to us. In this proposal the principal investigator will use analytical and numerical tools to study how waves and light beams behave as they travel inside of random media.//\n",
      "a9003232 INT $18250 This award will support Professor Richard Fisher of the University of California at Santa Barbara in a research collaboration with Professors G. Orsi, G. Capaldi, and L. Civetta of the University of Naples. One of southern Europe's great cities, Naples, is located on a young (approximately 33,500 years), large volume (greater than 80 cubic kilometers) ignimbrite sheet resulting from a volcanic eruption. This Campanian Ignimbrite (CI), occurs up to 100 km. from its probable source, having moved as an energetic pyroclastic flow across high mountain ridges. The source of the CI is believed to be in the Phlegrean Fields, located in the Neapolitan suburbs. The researchers intend (1) to establish chronology and chemical trends of the initial Campanian eruption that produced the first-deposited tephra and the ignimbrite sheet; (2) to determine the type of initiating eruption (pryoclastic and/or hydroclastic) and subsequent eruptive activity; and (3) to interpret flow mechanisms by studying the origin of the thin ground layer that occurs beneath the CI. Detailed field and laboratory studies of this ignimbrite are necessary for the purpose of unraveling its history and what that portends for future activity. If the CI originated from beneath the sea, it will be the first such ignimbrite to be documented, and it would be possible for the first time to characterize physical and chemical attributes of subaqueous ignimbrite and provide petrologic criteria for their recognition.\n",
      "a9003234 IBN $7192 The sea snail Aplysia possesses very large nerve cells which enable researchers to study the nervous system at the molecular and cellular level. Analytical techniques are used to study the cellular changes which form the biological basis for habituation and learning in this mollusc. Aplysia, and other related species, have been useful in the investigation of the neurological basis of complex behavioral patterns. A conference, under the auspices of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, has been planned to assemble researchers studying the cell and molecular biology of Aplysia. The intent of this meeting is to discuss new methods and findings that have emerged from the successful utilization of the Aplysian nervous system.\n",
      "a9003240 INT $14510 This award provides funds to permit Dr. Arthur J. Freeman, Department of Physics, Northwestern University, to pursue with Dr. Jae Il Lee, Department of Physics, Inha University, Dr. Soon Cheol Hong, Department of Physics, University of Ulsan, and Dr. Byung Il Min, Department of Physics, Pohang Institute of Science and Technology (POSTECH), for 24 months, a program of cooperative research on structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of bulk solids, surfaces, and interfaces. In this project, these scientists will use newly developed computational methods/algorithms which are the product of their past collaboration. A wide range of phenomena will be investigated jointly using these computational methods, including the structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of metals, semiconductors, insulators, and their compounds, overlays, and superlattices. This research is based on the assumption that the properties of macroscopic samples of solid material are related to and can be derived from the electronic structure of individual molecules and atomic building blocks of that material. A high degree of reliability concerning predictions of physical and chemical properties and phenomena has been achieved using highly sophisticated, fully self-consistent local density computer codes for the calculation of electronic structures of these materials. A wide range of phenomena will be investigated. Applications include understanding the properties and design of new intermetallic compounds and artificial materials. The collaborators are highly respected scientists in the field of this research. Their past collaboration has resulted in significant contributions to the literature of this field. This project will provide valuable support for the PI's work with the (U.S.) multi-institutional Materials Research Group on the Magnetic Properties of Materials. This project is relevant to the objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program which seeks to increase the level of cooperation between U.S. and Korean scientists and engineers through the exchange of scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through collaboration on problems of mutual benefit. Korean participation in the project is supported by the Korea Science and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).\n",
      "a9003242 HRD $133359 This research will apply interdisciplinary research methods to public sector accountability issues. Use of interdisciplinary methods will be enhanced through a joint association with the College of Engineering and the Institute for Public Policy Studies. Public sector accountability and performance evaluation will be addressed by investigating the choice of accounting practices and the nature and amount of auditing performed by state and local governments. This will expand on the research in public sector decision.making by: (1) conducting field studies to gain a greater understanding of the organizational factors and conditions which influence government accounting practices, budgetary allocations, and auditing choice; (2) using the organizational theory literature and insights from the field studies to contribute to the theory of accounting and auditing choice under conditions of uncertainty; and (3) empirically testing the implications drawn from the organizational theory literature. Analogies will be drawn between this decision setting and similar group decision scenarios that involve diverse parties with conflicting goals. Dr. Carpenter will teach a research seminar in public sector accountability issues and a section of an engineering economy course which considers theories of capital allocation in private and public sector organizations during the second year. Additionally, she will work with the university's Minority Program Office to develop strategies and programs to increase the number of minority females pursuing careers in the sciences. This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering by providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers employed in industry, government, and academic institutions. By encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a valuable investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.\n",
      "a9003244 DBI $1247182 The Provasoli-Guillard Center contains the world's largest culture collection of marine phytoplankton. The cultures are distributed to scientists, aquaculture hatcheries, industrial firms (especially biotechnology companies), and governmental agencies throughout the world. Marine phytoplankters are the \"plants\" of the ocean and they form the base of the food chain in ocean systems. Because oceans cover over 70% of the Earth's surface, phytoplankton play a dominant role in global ecology. Scientists use cultures of phytoplankton in experiments to study the potential effects of global changes caused by carbon dioxide increases (the greenhouse effect) and of ultraviolet light damage from ozone holes, as well as searching the diversity of phytoplankton organisms for natural products that may be used to cure human or other diseases. The recent rapid expansion of marine aquaculture is largely due to the use of phytoplankton cultures as foods for larval and juvenile shellfish and finfish. This project will provide partial support for the Provasoli- Guillard Center's maintenance costs of the phytoplankton culture collection for the next five years. Living phytoplankton must be maintained continuously in culture, since no methods have been perfected for their cryopreservation. During the award period, the Center will begin a major revision of its computer database, and will provide on-line access to the database. It will also install new culture chambers to enable a wider range of cultures to be maintained. Finally, a replacement autoclave will be purchased for sterilization of media and glassware in order to insure pure culture conditions.\n",
      "a9003245 DMS $19040 The principal investigator will continue in his new area of research, which is at the interface between probability and dynamical systems. In particular Lacey will consider the question of which stochastic processes can arise as limits of dynamical systems.\n",
      "a9003252 IIS $72932 Dr. Bezdek intends to extend the generalized fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering algorithm to include the Minkowsi norm family, suitable for detecting clusters in \"boxy\" data distributions. He will then elaborate the relationship between FCM and Kohonen's self-organizing feature maps, strengthing the theoretical foundations of each. These advances will be tested against standard algorithms using data from medical image analysis (radionuclide angiocardiography, EEG brain maps) and multisensor target detection.\n",
      "a9003253 CCR $275845 The objective of this project is the study of algorithms and complexity, focusing on specific application areas and methodologies. This project is aimed to further our understanding of local search and some other important computational problems whose answers are guaranteed to exist. The research involves development of rigorous techniques for attacking various computational problems with an \"artificial intelligence\" flavor, such as prehension and exploration by robots, and probabilistic logic, a complexity-based understanding of certain aspects of Economic Theory and Game Theory, and study of problems in security and communication in very large networks, and certain novel optimization problems related to communication networks.\n",
      "a9003255 DMS $44885 The research concerns the topic of multivariate statistical distributions with given marginals. Frechet bounds for the distribution functions will be improved through the imposition of additional constraints such as a specific value for the correlation or the requirement that the joint distributions have symmetry or unimodality. Various orderings and measures for the distributions will be studied and, in particular, alternative orderings to invariance under strictly increasing marginal transformations. The suitability of approximations to complicated multivariate distributions by relatively tractable multivariate distributions will be examined. Some of the methods of extending univariate distributions to higher dimensions that will be studied are independent bases, characterizations, sampling from Bernoulli or Urn models, shock models and mixtures.\n",
      "a9003256 DMS $33500 This award will provide support for Juan Redondo, who is a postdoc at the University of Michigan working with Professor Jeff Rauch. Dr. Redondo plans to continue his study of the regularity of free boundaries in the solutions of parabolic variational inequalities like the ones associated with the classical Stefan problem. He is also going to investigate the regularity of shock wave solutions of hyperbolic conservation laws by applying his variational techniques to the parabolic systems that come from adding viscous terms to the original hyperbolic systems. Nonlinear partial differential equations describe many dissipative phenomena like the flow of heat. If the amount of dissipation is small the solutions of such equations often behave as if there is no dissipation at all. In this grant the postdoc, Juan Redondo, will use techniques from variational theory that exploit this relationship between dissipative and non-dissipative systems in order to study things like the shape of a boundary between different materials and the sharpness of a front between gases of different densities.\n",
      "a9003257 DMS $47291 This project will support research in the area of nonlinear dispersive systems, in particular, the nonlinear Schrodinger equation and the Zakharov equation. The research will be focused in four areas: (1) nonlinear scattering and stability, (2) singularity formation and nucleation for the nonlinear Schrodinger equation and Zakharov systems, (3) dispersion of low energy solutions of equations arising in the mathematical description of the propagation of long waves, and (4) parametric resonance in Hamiltonian systems and the effect of dissipation. Nonlinear wave phenomena arise in physical systems ranging from the quantum level to the large scale motion of fluids in oceans. Problems in nonlinear waves can be studied using various techniques: analytical, formal asymptotics, and computer simulations.\n",
      "a9003263 DMS $52000 The principal investigator will study construction of constant scalar curvature Kaehler manifolds of complex dimension 2 by two different methods. The first of these involves a generalized Gibbon-Hawking ansatz, while the second uses the Banach space inverse function theorem applied to Kaehler potentials with point singularities of conormal type. He will also study global deformations of complete non-compact Riemannian manifolds with quaternionic holonomy. Lastly, he will investigate the global structure of the universal curve for Riemann surfaces with spin structure. In this project, the principal investigator will analyze complex manifolds which relate to twistor and string theory. These mathematical theories have been used to explain some of the behavior of subatomic particles. Manifolds are mathematical objects which include regular curves and surfaces as examples. Both of these examples are based on multiple copies of the real numbers. In this study, manifolds which are based on copies of the complex numbers, instead of the real numbers, will be used to analyze several questions arising from physics.\n",
      "a9003270 MCB $5000 The third annual \"Mouse Molecular Genetics\" meeting is scheduled to be held in Cold Spring Harbor, August 29 to September 2 and is expected to attract about 350 scientists working on various aspects of the molecular biology and molecular genetics of the mouse. The emphasis of the meeting will be on the mouse as an organism (as opposed to in vitro studies) and will cover such areas as: regulation of gene expression, cell proliferation and oncogenesis, models of disease processes embryonic stem cells, and molecular analysis of mutations. In the past, sessions on germ cells and the development of hemopoietic system were arranged based upon the number of interesting abstracts submitted in these areas. We hope to have enough interest in neurobiology to have a separate session this year. The use of homologous recombination to disrupt specific genes has been featured in previous meetings and this year should reveal the fruits of this powerful technique as applied to various interesting genes in the mouse. The meeting is intended for students and post docs as well as established investigators. All applicants will be expected to submit an abstract- about a third will be selected for 10 minute talks along with the invited speakers and the rest will present posters. The abstracts will be collated into a booklet that will be available to all attendees but proceedings will not be published. This has been a very successful meeting the last two years and feel that it still fills an important niche by allowing cross communication between various disciplines.\n",

The multi-processor system is based on AT-type single-board computers. This will: 1. permit solution of large problems 2. increase execution speed with parallel processing, and 3. give a group of graduate student new insight into multi-processor hardware and software problems, including dynamic model partitioning.\n",
      "a9003287 DMS $64000 The research project is concerned with the numerical solution of several classes of linear and nonlinear integral equations. Specific types of integral equations slated for study include linear and nonlinear boundary integral equations, nonlinear Urysohn equations and nonlinear Fredholm equations. Such equations arise in a host of pure and applied areas, and one of the goals of the research is the development of multi-purpose codes that can be fitted into software routines to enable researchers from many different disciplines to solve these integral equations efficiently and accurately. Very often the solution of a problem in mathematical physics or mathematical biology can be expressed in the form of an integral equation. However this does not mean that the problem is solved; rather, the resulting integral equation must be solved either analytically or numerically. In this proposal the researchers will improve existing numerical schemes and develop new ones in order to produce multi-purpose software for the approximate solution of several types of integral equations in several space dimensions.\n",
      "a9003288 DMS $174100 This project treats algebraic (and analytic) actions on affine varieties from the viewpoint of smooth (differentiable) transformation groups. The subject of smooth transformation groups has been strongly influenced by the following two central problems: LINEARITY PROBLEM. Which groups act nonlinearly on affine space of some dimension? (An action is linear if it is conjugate to an action defined by a representation of the group.) FIXED POINT PROBLEM. Which groups act without fixed points on affine space of some dimension? The tools used to settle these problems and the further problems they generated have been important themes in the field of smooth transformation groups. During the last few years researchers from algebraic transformation groups as well as those from smooth transformation groups have recognized the importance of these two questions in the algebraic category, and in that case the groups dealt with should be reductive (which includes as a special case the finite groups). Petrie will continue his work in this direction, bringing topological methods to bear on algebraic questions.\n",
      "a9003290 DMS $58646 This project will involve the study of various variational problems in dynamical systems and partial differential equations. The basic problems studied include (a) three and n-body type problems, (b) the Weinstein conjecture, which concerns periodic orbits on odd-dimensional compact manifolds, (c) the existence of solutions to superlinear elliptic problems, and (d) elliptic variational problems involving the critical Sobolev exponent, including problems on contractible domains and curvature problems. In addition to making contributions in the areas of partial differential equations and differential geometry, this work can be applied to dynamical systems and potential theory.\n",
      "a9003292 CCR $196825 Testing sequential logic circuits and systems is the research subject. Solutions to this problem usually require costs that are, for many applications, too formidable to allow wide adoption. The goal is to find low cost techniques that reduce overhead of time, area and test data volume while maintaining high fault coverage. The approach is to use the notions of partial scan and partial BIST, which show promise in testing sequential circuits. One research thrust is to develop new measures of testability and a new criteria for scan element selection. A second is to systematically avoid elements of existing techniques that contribute to high costs. Effective test algorithms are being developed by using scan elements derived from information about the actual test generator. Substantial empirical evaluation with experimental tools using real circuits is being done.\n",
      "a9003295 DBI $47705 The Human Genome Project burst upon the scene in the 1985. Since then, it has been a major topic of debate among life scientists. The Genome Project is often touted as the first foray into Big Biology -- a biological equivalent to the Apollo and Manhattan Projects. While much of this is mere hyperbole, proposing to examine human genetics at the cellular, organismal, and population levels is nonetheless audacious. The specific components of genome projects -- genetic maps, physical maps, DNA sequence information, and tools to produce and analyze these -- will be useful for the future study of human biology and pathology. The techniques and instruments will be applicable to the study of all organisms. The debate about genome projects has had the feel of historical importance since its inception. Those arguing for and against it, but particularly the proponents, have self-consciously placed the Project in a prominent position among the landmarks of biology. Whether it belongs in this pantheon remains to be seen, but the quality and intensity of debate and the extraordinary power and character of the advocates makes the Human Genome Project a wonderful case study in how a scientific project is placed on the national agenda, and what transpires once it is there. The Genome Project is thus and ideal opportunity to document the life sciences in transition from pure cottage industry to a mix of Big and little science. If the Project proves as important as some believe it will, then document its early history will be of immense interest to future historians, sociologists, philosophers, and political scientists, not to mention medical doctors and scientists. If the Project fails to meet expectations, then it will be a conspicuous failure and its early history will still be of great interest. Dr. Cook-Deegan, former Executive Director of the Biomedical Ethics Advisory Committee, along with Doris Goldstein, Director, and Anita Nolen, Archivist, of the Kennedy Institute Library of Georgetown University, will assemble a comprehensive bibliography and create an oral history resource focused on the early history of the Genome Project. Because of the evanescence of documentation and memory of the individuals involved, it is essential to move quickly now.\n",
      "a9003298 DMS $37874 The objective of this research is to understand the structure and dynamics of supercoiled DNA. Emphasis will be on the determination of the three-dimensional structure of supercoiled DNA as a function of linking number; upon the prediction of interaction of local segments that are separated by a considerable distance along the contour length of the DNA; and upon the elucidation of the effects on DNA structure of wrapping on a protein surface. The specific aims are divided into three categories. (1) Description of the tertiary structure of supercoiled DNA using the finite element method. The finite element method from nonlinear structural mechanics will be applied to the analysis of closed DNA structure. Energy minimization criteria will be used to predict the most stable configuration at each linking number. The writhe and twist will be calculated and the results used to predict the hydrodynamic behavior of closed DNA as well as the equilibrium distribution of topoisomers. (2) Description of the generalized helical periodicity of supercoiled DNA. The generalized winding number and generalized helical repeat will be defined for supercoiled DNA and a formula for the linking number of the DNA developed in terms of this winding number. These results will be applied to various experiments involving nuclease digestion and chemical probes in vitro and phasing in vivo. (3) Determination of the writhe, the surface twist and the surface linking number for DNA wrapped on piecewise smooth surfaces. Writhe and the surface twist will be calculated for closed circular DNA wrapped on a connected series of proteins of various geometric shapes. The writhe will be analyzed into its piecewise components and into the contributions due to pairwise interactions, including those between the protein complexes, between the linker regions, and between the protein complexes and the linker regions.\n",
      "a9003299 CCR $67436 The goal of this program is the development of a theoretical foundation for research in parallel computation and computational geometry.

(1) Geometric constructions in parallel (2) Parallel data structuring techniques (3) Geometric problems from graphics and solid modeling In addition, many of the algorithms will be implemented on existing hardware to experimentally benchmark the overhead inherent in these algorithms.\n",
      "a9003303 CTS $125000 The objectives of this study are the identification of intermediates in the partial and total oxidations of olefins on silver (110) surfaces, and quantification of the energetics of elementary steps in these processes. This includes, for partial oxidation, the production, identification, and characterization of the metallocycle intermediates relevant to catalytic oxidtion by both atomically and molecularaly adsorbed oxygen, and, for total oxidation , the investigation of the mechanism of propylene combustion. Electron energy loss spectroscopy is used to identify adsorbed intermediates and to measure the rates of reactions in which they participate, and temperature-programmed desorption is used to identify desorption products and to measure the rates of desorption. Partial oxidation of olefins, the process involved in this study, is of great commerical importance, but as presently practiced, can be applied only to a very few olefins. The results of this study could lead to better control and improved yields in the existing process. More significantly, it may point the way for extending this approach to additional olefins, which would represent a technological breakthough.\n",

      "a9003308 CHE $318500 This grant is in the general field of analytical and surface chemistry and in the subfield of spectroscopy of liquid solid interfaces. Professor Marc Porter of Iowa State University will use monomolecular films at solid surfaces to develop structure-property and structure-reactivity relationships relevent to surface chemical reactions. The use of electrochemically active functional groups specifically synthesized at the liquid-solid interface will allow the study of surface pH gradients. Optical spectroscopic methods will be used to probe the self assembled thiophenyl linkages at platinum and gold electrode surfaces. Surface infrared, spectroelectrochemistry and surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy will be used to study the reactivity and transformation of functional groups at the monolayer interface. Probe molecules will be used to determine Hammett linear free energy relationships. Spatially oriented arrays of pendant reactive functional groups (carboxylic acids, amines, esters and quinones) will be constructed and the effects of packing density, orientation and composition on reactivity will be explored. Electrochemical parameters will also be explored as a means to control reactivity and structure.\n",

The investigation will focus on molecular rearrangements of reactive molecular species and will result in an improved understanding of the fundamental processes by which chemical reactions occur. The experiments that will be carried out by Dr. McMahon will involve a systematic study of intramolecular hydrogen migration in electron deficient organic intermediates and isolobal, organometallic analogs. Low-temperature matrix isolation techniques will be employed to establish rearrangement pathways and to characterize intermediate species by spectroscopic methods. Experiments will be designed to probe the roles of spin-multiplicity, orientation, distance, and thermodynamic driving force for the rearrangements.\n",
      "a9003322 DMS $53750 This award supports the research on p-adic Galois repre- sentations of Professor Shankar Sen of Cornell University. Dr. Sen's project consists of two parts: the first is to relate the generalized Hodge-Tate structure of the representation to the various p-adic liftings of global Galois representations over the prime field in characteristic p. The other part is to extend previous work of Dr. Sen that described p-adic field extensions by means of certain semi-linear integral representations of p- power cyclic groups. Except for counting, number theory, which is the study of the properties of the whole numbers, is the oldest branch of mathematics. In modern days, problems in number theory have furnished the driving force to creation of new mathematics in the fields of pure algebra, analysis, and geometry; some of the most recent and most astonishing applications of number theory have appeared in theoretical computer science and coding theory.\n",

The first investigator, Dr. Bhattacharya, will continue his work on asymptotic expansions and on large time stability in certain important classes of nonlinear stochastic systems. Asymptotic expansions is a field central to statistics, and the investigator will consider refinements of the Gaussian approximation in central limit theorem motivated by applications, e.g. in analyzing bootstrap methodology. The second topic lies between dynamical systems at one end and nonsingular or irreducible Markov processes at the other. The second investigator, Dr. Chan, will work on problems related to statistical inference for nonstationary time series with infinite variance. This study is motivated by economics, finance, and communications engineering.\n",

Several related questions in the analysis of solitary waves will be examined, including their existence, uniqueness and stability. In addition, the validity of various approximate equations and certain rigorous properties of nonlinear dispersive systems of partial differential or integro- differential equations will be considered. The tools of nonlinear analysis will be supplemented by some numerical simulation and the special methods of inverse scattering theory. The systems to be studied arise in many areas of nonlinear science including fluid mechanics, nonlinear optics, solid state physics, oceanography and meteorology.\n",
      "a9003327 INT $20250 This proposal requests funds to permit Dr. M. Howard Lee, Professor of Physics, University of Georgia, to pursue with Dr. Jongbae Hong, Associate Professor of Physics, Seoul National University, for a period of 24 months, a program of cooperative research on the dynamical behavior of an electron gas. Specifically, the research will address problems concerning the frequency or time dependent behavior of electron gases, such as critical damping of the plasmon, dynamics of a classical electron gas and the fifth moment, and dynamics of a layered electron gas. The time and frequency behavior of an electron gas at metallic densities has been the subject of intense research by a number of workers during the past decade. The present cooperative project is based on advances made in research under NSF Grant No. INT-8517639 on the time and frequency dependent response of an electron gas at metallic densities and at intermediate wave vectors. This research may contribute to a better understanding of electronic systems in metal-oxide-semiconductors and in heterostructures. This project is relevant to the objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program which seeks to increase the level of cooperation between U.S. and Korean scientists and engineers through the exchange of information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through collaboration on problems of mutual interest and benefit. Support for Korean participation in the project is provided by the Korea Science and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).\n",
      "a9003328 DMR $170500 The goal of this research is to improve the quality of bulk crystals by study and modification of the temperature field at the crystal growth front. A modified Czochralski process which will incorporate a heater immersed in the melt just below the crystal growth will be studied experimentally to obtain a flat growth-front profile which is expected to provide bulk crystals with reduced defects. Primary studies at the PI's facility will be carried out with NaNO3, and the information learned transferred to the growth of other materials such as GaAs and InP, in collaboration with AT&T Laboratories.\n",
      "a9003329 DMS $43900 This award supports the research in analytic number theory of Professor Daniel Goldston of San Jose State University. Dr. Goldston's project involves a study of the fine details in the pattern of distribution of prime numbers. He plans to examine the Hardy-Littlewood circle method and its application to the study of small gaps between primes and the exceptional sets for the Goldbach conjecture; the Riemann zeta function as a tool for studying large gaps between primes; Maier's method and differential delay questions; and connections of these methods with the emerging understanding of the duality between primes and zeros of zeta functions. The field of analytic number theory applies to the discrete realm of the whole numbers the techniques of analysis, dependent on the notions of continuity and limit, originating in calculus. The idea of using continuous methods to investigate the discrete is two centuries old, but with the work of the modern analytic number theorists such as Professor Goldston, the field has had a new rebirth.\n",
      "a9003333 DMS $55515 The principal investigator will study a method for showing that all closed 3-manifolds with positive scalar curvature are obtained from spherical space forms by performing connected sums. An analogous problem for 4-manifolds with positive isotropic curvature will be analyzed. Other parts of the project include investigations into the four-dimensional Schoenflies conjecture, as well as studies of Kaehler and symplectic structures. A closed curve on a sphere, which does not have any intermediate intersections, separates the plane into two disks. Analogously, a properly smooth sphere lying in ordinary 3-space bounds one ball, and bounds a second ball if infinity is collapsed to a point. The principal investigator will study a method using heat flow to solve the analogous problem for three- dimensional smooth spheres lying in four-dimensional space.\n",
      "a9003335 DMS $195530 Professor Douglas plans to continue his research in two areas: multivariable spectral theory and the study of invariants for differential operators on manifolds with boundary and on foliated manifolds. His research in multivariable operator theory will involve the study of Hilbert modules from the viewpoint of analytic and algebraic geometry. The study of invariants for differential operators will involve the Chern character for operators on a manifold with boundary. This research involves the theory of Hilbert space operators. These are essentially infinite matrices of complex numbers. Such objects have applications in every area of applied science as well as in pure mathematics. This type of research is an attempt to classify certain important classes of Hilbert space operators.\n",
      "a9003337 DMS $103047 The principal investigators continue studies of nonlinear partial differential equations. The present investigations include symmetry-breaking for solutions of nonlinear wave equations, solutions of semilinear equations with finite symmetry groups, conformal metrics on the two-dimensional sphere, radially symmetric solutions of Einstein-Yang-Mills equations, shock wave problems, and certain problems of topology. These mathematical questions capture features of a variety of physical problems. For instance, questions addressed in the Einstein-Yang-Mills studies have implications for the importance of quantum effects in forming black holes. Many problems in mathematical biology, physics, and geometry have solutions that show certain patterns or symmetries. Symmetry-breaking indicates changes in the character of the solutions as parameters of the problems change.\n",
      "a9003339 DMS $180000 This project will study the mechanisms involved in the development of pattern and form in embryology. This is to develop and analyze mathematical models for generating specific patterns and appendages on the integument, specifically alligator stripe patterns, feather and scale primordia and primate fingerprints. The models are constructed around known biological facts and close contact will be maintained with experimental collaborators. The nonlinear partial differential equation systems which constitute the models will be investigated analytically and numerically. The mathematical techniques used will primarily be linear analysis, nonlinear bifurcation theory and numerical simulation. Development of appropriate graphical presentation of the patterned solutions of the equations will play an important part. The results and biological predictions will be compared with the biological data and hopefully will be used to motivate specific experiments to try and elucidate the real patterning process. Much of the research is closely linked to specific experimental studies currently underway. The work emphasizes the need for integrating theoretical studies with experimental and observational facts.\n",
      "a9003341 IIS $114767 This research focuses on performance issues in rule-based knowledge bases that have to manage large amounts of rules and data. An effective implementation of such systems, particularly if they are distributed, has proven to be a major stumbling block in the way of their efficient performance. In this project, parallel processing for solving the performance problem is investigated. The goals of the research are: (1) to establish a theory of parallel and distributed rule processing; and (2) based on the theory, to devise processing strategies and criteria for comparing them, so that an optimal strategy can be selected for a given rule-based program, data structures, and a parallel/distributed architecture. The results of the research will be experimentally evaluated in Net-mate, a system for management of very large communication networks (hundreds of thousands of interconnected computers), that is currently under development at Columbia University. An important issue in network management is automatic detection of fault conditions. Rule-based programming is ideal for this purpose, but it requires the analysis of very large amounts of statistical and configuration data that is distributed, leading to the type of performance problems that this research aims to solve. Hence, the Net-mate system is an ideal testbed for this research, and both projects are expected to benefit from the cooperation and provide results applicable to distributed and parallel computing.\n",
      "a9003343 DMS $40620 Professor Packer will study two topics under the general heading of twisted crossed product C* algebras: (i) the topological structure of the primitive ideal space of twisted group C* algebras related to nilpotent groups, and (ii) K- theoretic invariants for certain twisted crossed product C* algebras. The notion of a C* algebra is an abstraction of the idea of a family of linear transformations on a space. These transformations can also be thought of as having values in the states of the space, and the property of this family which is responsible for the symbol * is that the algebra is generated by transformations whose values in these states are real numbers. The fact that these objects appear naturally in many branches of mathematics and physics make them important to study.\n",
      "a9003353 DMS $39000 This is a grant under the Scientific Computing Research Equipment for the Mathematical Sciences program of the Division of Mathematical Sciences of the National Sciences Foundation. This program supports the purchase of special purpose computing equipment dedicated to the conduct of research in the mathematical sciences. This equipment is required for several research projects and would be difficult to justify for one project alone. Support from the National Science Foundation is coupled with discounts and contributions from manufacturers and with substantial cost-sharing from the institutions submitting the proposal. This program is an example of academic, corporate, and government cooperation in the support of the basic research in the mathematical sciences. This equipment will be used to support five research projects in the Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science of the University of Iowa: estimation of multivariate variance components by maximum likelihood and minimum distance criteria, the investigators are James Calvin and Richard Dykstra; analysis of telemetry data - finding the location of a signal, the investigators are Johannes Ledolter, Russell Lenth and Anderson- Sprecher; robust scale estimation in quality -improvement problems, the investigators are Robert Hogg, Marianthi Markatou, and Lenth; some topics in spatial statistics, the investigator is Dale Zimmerman; predictive regression estimators for finite population values using functions of the probability of selection, the investigator is Louis Rizzo.\n",
      "a9003356 CCR $50705 The study of algorithms involves two important aspects, correctness and complexity. This project addresses these two aspects from a machine independent viewpoint by using formulas of mathematical logic. Logic formulas can provide descriptions of solutions to problems which can then be analyzed for their correctness and complexity. Of particular interest is to develop a feasible set of logical formulas for P, the class of problems which are tractable, i.e., whose solutions require only a polynomial number of machine steps, and in addition, to provide a system for reasoning about the properties of these logical formulas. Finding a comprehensive description of such a set of formulas would exhibit a machine independent definition of P and have a significant impact on our understanding of the algorithms for this important complexity class. If successful, this system could provide a method by which one could demonstrate that a given formula is the correct solution to certain problem. As an alternative to program correctness, this may provide a deeper understanding of algorithmic correctness.\n",
      "a9003361 DMS $155600 Two investigators will study Kleinian groups and Teichmuller spaces. One will analyze deformation spaces and cohomology of Kleinian groups, moduli of Riemann surfaces and their explicit representations, automorphic forms, and projective structures. The second will continue his investigation into the structure of Kleinian groups and hyperbolic 3-orbifolds emphasizing the classification of geometrically finite groups and combination theorems. The two investigators will work toward solving several problems related to the study of Kleinian groups. An example of such a group would be a collection of motions of the plane which preserve a periodic tiling. As elements of a group these must satisfy several axioms including one which requires the existence of an inverse element associated with each element of the group. If one element translates the plane by two units to the \"right,\" its inverse element would translate the plane two units to the \"left.\" The study of such motions has led mathematicians to the solutions of problems involving crystal structures.\n",
      "a9003364 ATM $110000 This is a study to investigate the transmission of errors by the teleconnection processes in the atmosphere. The project consists of three parts, (a) to use the DERF dataset for testing the hypothesis that the location of maximum response to tropical forcing is \"phase locked\", (b) to examine the response of a simplified NMC GCM to a variety of tropical forcing scenarios, and (c) to investigate the response of the NMC operational GCM to tropical forcing. This project is important because it will help to clarify a potentially significant source of uncertainty in the present meteorological operational data analyses. In addition the study will benefit the ongoing efforts for designing more effective observational platforms and networks.\n",

The objective is to stimulate research in the U.S. on plant reproduction, specifically on the study of gametes and fertilization in flowering plants, by presenting current research in the field. Emphasis will be on the questions being asked and the experimental approaches used to answer them. Topics will include isolation and characterization of sperm and eggs, fertilization in vivo and in vitro and methods used in the study of algal gametes and fertilization. By inviting international speakers and Americans who have worked abroad, the symposium will provide an overview of this expanding international field. Invited talks will be followed by an open session of contributed papers on plant gametes and fertilization to which any member may submit an abstract. %%% Sexual reproduction in flowering plants has emerged as an area of significant scientific progress in the last five years, in addition to its obvious importance to agriculture. This meeting will provide access for U.S. scientists to the latest work in this area.\n",
      "a9003373 DMS $77480 The principal investigator will develop specific probability models for testing, evaluating and applying classifications. Classification is the method of constructing classes of similar objects. The established models for this purpose are mixture models, modal models, and for evolutionary classification, generalized Markov models. The investigator introduces a new class of probability models, product partition models, that have wide application in classification, both for evaluating and selecting classifications, and for using classifications in prediction. He also considers more specialized probability models for devising significance tests for the existence of clusters, and for reconstructing evolutionary trees.\n",
      "a9003374 DMS $49400 This research is concerned with integral extensions of noncommutative rings. The principal investigator will determine if an algebra, with a Hopf algebra action, is integral over the invariant subring. He will also examine when a smash product is integral over the coefficient ring. These results and techniques will be used to study the prime spectra of the rings involved. This project is in the general area of ring theory. A ring is an algebraic object having both an addition and a multiplication defined on it. These objects arise naturally in various branches of mathematics, physics and computer science.\n",
      "a9003376 DMS $46080 This award supports the research in combinatorics of Professor Jeffry Kahn of Rutgers University. Dr. Kahn will be conducting investigations in the following topics: the properties of hypergraphs (collections of finite sets); the problem of giving a good estimate of the probability that a random square matrix of order n, in which all entries are zero or 1, should be singular; and Chvatal's conjecture on intersecting families in ideals in finite Boolean algebras. This research falls in the broad category of combinatorics, which is one of the most active fields in today's mathematics. Fundamentally, combinatorics represents a systematization of the very first of all mathematical activities, counting. In its modern development, however, combinatorics has gone beyond just counting to make use of a wide variety of advanced mathematical techniques, and although its roots go back several centuries, the field has had an explosive development in the past few decades because of its importance in communications and information technology.\n",
      "a9003383 DMS $57795 This research in statistical methods involves probability models for the rankings that result when a group of subjects each independently ranks a set of items from first place to last place. These include Thurstone order statistics models, ranking models induced by paired comparisons and models based on distances between rankings. In many practical problems the probability of observing any particular ranking is affected by the values of one or more independent variables, or subject covariates, associated with the subjects performing the ranking. In a different but related situation, covariates associated with the items can be used to describe the probability distribution of the ranking. A principal goal of the proposed research is to investigate the consequences of different methods of incorporating the information contained in both item and subject covariates. The performance of the methods, which allow for the development of formal inferential and graphical techniques for studying the effects of the covariates, will be evaluated. A semi-parametric approach will be described to detect systematic differences between rankings which arise in pairs, such as pre- and post-treatment rankings produced by the same subject. Residual spectral analytic techniques will be applied to ranking models in general and covariate models in particular. Diagnostics based on the distributional properties of the residuals will be developed.\n",

The Special Year is centered around the yearlong visits of Knebusch and Broecker, who are experts in real algebraic geometry. There will be researchers from Europe and North America visiting Berkeley during this Special Year. The main activities will be two seminars: one on real algebraic geometry and the other on the algebraic theory of quadratic forms.\n",
      "a9003398 IBN $320000 Syringomycin is a peptide phytotoxin produced by the bacterium, Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae. The toxin is a major virulence factor in many plant and crop diseases. Previous work supported by NSF showed that syringomycin's primary site of action is the host plasma membrane. Several plasma membrane- associated events caused by syringomycin were demonstrated including changes in K+ efflux, Ca2+ influx, H+-pump ATPase activity, membrane charge potential, and protein phosphorylation. Also, the structure of syringomycin was determined. Further studies on the mechanism of action of the syringomycin are being pursued. The studies exploit the action of the toxin on the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Preliminary studies revealed that syringomycin affects S. cerevisiae in ways which resemble its effects on plant plasma membranes. Syringomycin-resistant, temperature-sensitive mutants are being isolated and characterized. The normal versions of the defective genes are being isolated by gene complementation techniques and characterized. These genes encode proteins that function in the syringomycin response pathway. Revertants with second-site suppressor mutations are being studied to determine how the identified gene products interact in the syringomycin response pathway. This project is significant because it determines how an important, ubiquitous bacterial phytotoxin causes plant disease and provides basic information about the function, structure and regulation of the plant cell plasma membrane.\n",

      "a9003404 AST $209000 Dr. Backer's research covers a range of studies in the general field of pulsar astrophysics. There are two principal foci: the development of new hardware for searching for pulsars with fast periods; and surveys to discover other interesting objects in this class. A set of these pulsars will be monitored as celestial clocks for precision experiments. Pulsars with millisecond periods and binary pulsars probably form a distinct class of neutron stars that have rotational periods which are processed by angular momentum transfer from a companion star. The solitary millisecond pulsars have an uncertain past, but may fit the binary scenario if evaporation of a companion can proceed to completion. Dr. Backer's research is involved in both finding new members of this class of pulsars, and in using millisecond pulsars as celestial clocks for precision measurements.\n",
      "a9003407 CMS $49999 This is a post Loma Prieta earthquake (Oct. 1989) investigation project in learning from this damaging event. This project studies one particular structure which faired remarkably well amidst similar buildings which suffered considerable damage during the earthquake. The Clarion Hotel complex is located in a region where high ground accelerations were measured due to the soft soil conditions near the San Francisco Airport. Interaction of the heavily reinforced pile foundation with the soil medium is suspected to have provided beneficial effects by mobilizing radiation and hysteretic damping. In addition, the pile flexibility may have provided a longer period than present in a fixed base structure. The effects of soil-pile-structure interaction on the performance of a portion of the hotel will be investigated using a complex response analysis in the frequency domain and a nonlinear time history analysis. The analysis utilizes and extends a methodology developed earlier to focus on interaction effects in an actual case. Important results expected include a comparison of the forces acting in the building and foundation elements as computed from the interactive and fixed base models, and an assessment of the period shift produced by pile flexibility.\n",
      "a9003409 MCB $225000 The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae makes a variety of glycoproteins, called mannoproteins owing to the high content of mannose. These mannoproteins contain both O- and N-linked carbohydrate chains, and differences in the structure of the carbohydrate component have been found between different mannoproteins and between mannoproteins localized to different parts of the cell. The synthesis of mature N-linked chains involves initiation of outer chain addition to the core precursor, followed by elongation, termination, branching, and then maturation by mannosylphosphorylation and alpha 1-3- mannosylation. The objective of this research is to investigate the enzymology of the termination reaction which regulates whether the N-linked chains are of the small or large type. A specific assay will be developed for the terminase activity so that it can be measured in the presence of other mannosyltransferases in crude extracts. The terminase will be purified by standard procedures, and factors that modulate its activity will be studied. Saccharomyces cerevisiae, common baker's yeast, provides a useful model for studies on eucaryotic development and on the structural function relationships of the carbohydrate component of glycoproteins. This work will lead to a better understanding of the developmental role of these compounds. Yeasts are important in biotechnology and the results of these studies may form the basis for developing new useful types of yeasts.\n",
      "a9003412 DMS $40000 About thirty-five years ago H. Lewy produced an example of a first order linear partial differential equation with linear (complex) coefficients which had no solution. A complete description of differential operators which are 'solvable' remains a challenging, but unresolved issue in mathematical analysis. However, the search has led to many fundamental results about partial differential operators, especially in the context of the theory of several complex variables. One of the more interesting aspects of the work in this area concerns the question of describing the range of an 'unsolvable' operator, or, equivalently, which inhomogeneous equations can be solved? The question is reformulated in terms of the null space of the adjoint: whether the projection operator onto the null space preserves real analyticity. The tools used to investigate the question in this project involve the calculus of pseudodifferential operators defined on a manifold, the Heisenberg group. Work will be done on the specific case of the Szego projection restricted to a real analytic boundary of a bounded pseudoconvex domain of finite type in two complex dimensions. Work will also be done investigating specific one-parameter families of differential operators of second order to determine conditions under which they will be analytic hypoelliptic and on pseudodifferential operators defined on general nilpotent Lie groups.\n",

During the one week of the Workshop, it is intended to illustrate a generic model of a one semester course on \"Introductory Computational Science\". This will be accomplished by lectures, demonstrations, video presentations and hands-on experiences using IBM personal computers, Apple Macintosh computers and remote supercomputers.\n",
      "a9003423 CCR $86319 Boolean categories provide a framework for programming language semantics. In contrast to the syntax-driven style commonly employed in theoretical computer science, there is but one primitive, program- chaining, in terms of which all other constructs must be expressed; extensive work by category theorists in the past four decades has demonstrated the feasibility of this approach. The abstract theory of Boolean categories and some of its specializations have been developed by the proposer and his close colleagues in the past ten years. This work has studied fundamental control structures including recursion. Further, all Boolean categories have an intrinsic theory of predicate transformation which provides a high-level specification language of logical assertions. It is a theorem that this specification language follows the lines of classical nondeterminism. By contrast, the choice of model is flexible enough to allow the hidden state to be arbitrarily complex, it being possible to represent very general forms of nondeterminism. The research centers on incorporating fairness and unbounded nondeterminism into the Boolean category framework.\n",
      "a9003430 SES $28000 Working with Dr. Peter Galison, Dr. Stump is undertaking a postdoctoral fellowship to study and conduct research at Stanford University. His research is centering on methodological issues surrounding new approaches to the philosophy of science which have arisen since the overthrow of logical positivism in the 1960's and 70's. Philosophers of science are now paying close attention to the history of science and to current scientific practice. The use of evidence from case studies can now be taken for granted as central to studies of scientific methodology. There are, however, competing views on what to do with historical evidence even among philosophers of science who agree that such evidence is important and who reject the incommensurability thesis (i.e. that advocates of a \"revolutionary\" scientific paradigm cannot meaningfully speak to advocates of the old paradigm because the theoretical terms they use have radically different, \"incommensurable\" meanings) associated with some anti-positivists. Dr. Stump is examining three methodological positions: Thomas Nickles view, \"local historicism,\" Larry Laudan's reworking of epistemology, \"normative naturalism,\" and Ronald Giere's \"cognitive science of science.\" Dr. Stump first is clearly formulating these positions, paying special attention to the issue of defining what is meant by \"local\" or context specific methodological rules. The second issue he is exploring is how to test general and prescriptive rules from the historical record and current scientific practice. The deep issue to be tested is whether any substantial methodological rules are legitimately universal or if all must remain context specific as the local historicists claim. He is attempting to settle this question using case studies from the history of science and current scientific practice.\n",

      "a9003438 DMS $260261 Work to be done on this project focuses on questions arising at the interface of geometry and mathematical analysis in Euclidean spaces. The basis for the research lies within the geometric development of complex function theory, in that it emphasizes the group structure underlying analytic function theory and the infinitesimal behavior of such functions. It was their infinitesimal regularity that led to the notion of quasiconformal mappings in the 1930's. Decades passed before an intrinsic definition of these mappings was found which could be applied to mappings in higher dimensions. This work is about those mappings and their underlying domains. A quasiconformal mapping is a univalent mapping between two domains which maps infinitesimal circles into infinitesimal ellipses whose major and minor axes have bounded (the dilatation) ratios. An important question in the understanding of their structure concerns the decomposition of maps into iterates of maps with the same dilatation. Those with no such decomposition would form a basis of irreducible maps. From the geometric side, one would like to know how to determine when two domains are equivalent under quasiconformal mappings. Even when one of the two domains is a ball, this question is very difficult. The sufficient conditions given by Schoenflies type theorems and the necessary ones arising from local connectivity are very far apart. Some progress has been made in three dimensions when one of the domains is a slit domain and the other is a ball. Other work, concentrating on planar problems, will be concerned with Kleinian groups. This includes continuing work on measuring the distance of elements from the identity in several natural metrics. When applied to generators of groups, information about the singular set can be obtained. As this work develops further, higher dimensional analogues will be studied. Work will also continue on discrete convergence groups, a class of transformation groups introduced several years ago which reflect many properties of Mobius groups (they are conjugate to such groups by quasiconformal maps). Investigations into the fine structure of convergence groups will be conducted.\n",

      "a9003441 CCR $142453 The primary goal of this research is to extend the theoretical basis for designing and maintaining programming languages. The ultimate goal of this line of research is to give programming language designers more ability to design languages which can be methodically extended in a variety of directions (e.g., the introduction of parallelism) and implemented on a variety of machines while preserving the correctness of existing programs. To achieve this goal, a number of basic conceptual issues, and some case studies will be examined to investigate the practical importance of the theory. The conceptual issues include the relations between operational, denotational, and axiomatic semantics, the definitional and conceptual power of structured operational semantics, and expressiveness of various sequential and parallel primitive operations. The case studies may include the design of parallel extensions of ML.\n",

Orbits which intersect the boundary perpendicularly are called symmetric. Work will also be done in examining rational periodic directions in rational triangles. It is known that every rational periodic direction must be a multiple of a fixed value computed from the three angles. It is believed that a converse statement also holds, although not universally. The proper conditions for a converse are still to be worked out. Other work will consider Furstenberg's correspondence and recurrence, minimal symbolic flows with linear block growth and minimal flows arising from substitutions.\n",
      "a9003454 ATM $154543 Heating of the ionosphere with intense radio waves has been pursued vigorously over the last thirty years, primarily in the United States and the Soviet Union. New, large facilities have been constructed in the United States and in Europe. During the 1970's, the branches of plasma physics known as weak turbulence theory and the theory of parametric instabilities were used to explain some of the unusual and unexpected results of the heating efforts. The PIs' recent work, inspired by Petviashvili and followed by that of DuBois, Rose, and others, has demonstrated the importance of modulational instability followed by Langmuir soliton formation and collapse. The PI proposes to continue his study of these effects using analytical and numerical techniques.\n",
      "a9003467 DMS $30088 The research involves the study of estimation in unbalanced multivariate variance components models using an approach based on a Fenchel duality formulation of the problem. The effort will be concentrated in estimation and testing of covariance matrices in multivariate variance component models, relating the results to appropriate fields of statistics, and studying rates of convergence of the proposed algorithms. The multivariate random effects model involves constraints that the covariance matrices of the random effects be nonnegative definite which leads to a Lowner ordering of matrices. Algorithms will be investigated find to the restricted maximum likelihood estimators of such matrices.\n",
      "a9003472 CMS $56099 This project focuses upon lessons that can be learned from the October 17, 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake. Existing knowledge about the effective communication of public disaster warnings largely rests on a data base of pre-impact warnings. A gap exists regarding knowledge about the determinants and process whereby the public hears, perceives and responds to warnings during the post-impact disaster emergency period. This research is a study of public perception and response to aftershock warnings following the Loma Prieta Earthquake. Mail questionnaires will collect relevant data on 800 households representing San Francisco (a media rich environment) and Santa Cruz (a media sparse environment) households. The process and determinants of that process whereby the public hears, perceives and responds to warnings during the immediate aftermath of a disaster will be determined. Quick-response field research after this quake suggest that there is much to be learned. This quake provides an opportunity to conduct a systematic study on this topic for perhaps the first time.\n",
      "a9003473 CMS $76388 This project addresses the lessons learned from the 17 October 1989 Northern California (Loma Prieta) earthquake. It is a continuation of a joint project with Professor Wayne Clough at Virginia Polytechnic Institute that was funded through the Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) program: The objectives of this project were: to gather relevant geotechnical data; to map ground features that are important to identify the extent of liquefaction and ground amplification effects; perform about 30 cone penetration tests at locations where earlier tests had been conducted; organize the above information into a computerized data base; and make preliminary assessments of the correlation between field observations and data obtained before and after the 1989 earthquake. The objectives of this continuation joint research project are to study the ground motion and liquefaction characteristics of the fill soils that surround the northern and eastern periphery of San Francisco as well as areas south of San Francisco. The fill soils are a major element in the damages that occurred in the Bay Area due to the Loma Prieta earthquake. Drs. G.R. Martin and E. Kavazanjian of the Earth Technology Corporation in Long Beach, CA, are participating as advisors, and the cone penetration and dilatometer testing is being accomplished using equipment of the Earth Technology Corporation. The motivation for this project lies in: the important lessons that can be learned from the observed response of the fills and underlying recent sediments to the earthquake; the unique opportunity to study sites that had been investigated in the 1970's and 80's and where specific predictions had been made as to expected performance; the ability to use the observed performance as a field laboratory to test the latest developments in the state-of-the-art; and the opportunity to generate results from research that has direct value in San Francisco and nearby communities.\n",

      "a9003483 EAR $50000 Experiments to determine the compositions of pyroxenes in the assemblage enstatite + diopside + forsterite + anorthite will be performed in the systems CaO-MgO-Al2O3-SiO at temperatures from 925oC to 1175oC, and pressures of 5000 and 7500 bars. Results from these experiments will be combined with results obtained earlier in this experimental program at atmospheric pressure, and at 2500 and 5000 bars. The experimental data will be used to construct and to constrain empirical and thermodynamic models of subsolidus pyroxene phase equilibria, which may then be applied to methods of estimating temperatures and pressures of equilibration of felspathic, mafic and ultramafic rocks. Pyroxene compositions will be reversed, both in terms of Ca/Mg ratio and Al contents by approaching the equilibrium compositions from starting compositions with both higher and lower values. Experiments will use vanadium pentoxide as a high-temperature solvent to promote grain growth and chemical equilibration; several lines of evidence developed earlier in this experimental program demonstrate that this technique produces negligible effects upon the equilibria under investigation. Analysis of compositions and phase assemblages will be performed petrographically, by electron microprobe, and powder X-ray diffraction, supplemented by scanning and transmission electron microscopy and single crystal X-ray diffraction as required.\n",
      "a9003484 DEB $56721 Mathematical and statistical methods will be developed to analyze and interpret DNA sequences from different individuals of the same species. The goal of the research is to use such data to achieve a greater understanding of processes governing genetic evolution, particularly mutation, recombination, gene conversion and gene flow. The methods developed will take advantage of the detailed information provided by within-species DNA sequence data. Particular attention will be paid to the phylogenetic relationships of genes as indicated by their sequences. The overall approach of the research will be to combine simple analytic models of simple problems with computer simulation models of more complex and realistic problems. The methods developed will be applied to available data. The plan is to spend one semester in Richard Lewontin's laboratory and Harvard University learning more about what kinds of data are available and working with Lewontin and his collaborators on the analysis of their data. //\n",
      "a9003485 DMS $0 The principal investigator will study several problems in differential geometry as applied to the theory of minimal surfaces. One involves an approach to proving the isometric inequality for minimal surfaces. The second involves applying generalized Morse index theory to obtain a sharp estimate for the index of a minimal surface. And he will analyze the problem of globally reflecting a constant mean curvature surface which meets a plane at a constant angle. Two-dimensional minimal surfaces are mathematical models of soap films. These must have zero mean curvature. The surface of a saddle has zero mean curvature if at each point the amount of curvature in the upward direction exactly cancels the amount in the downward direction. The principal investigator will study various problems concerning the number of tubes such minimal surfaces may have.\n",
      "a9003486 OCE $44849 This project will develop a series of numerical simulations to determine the influence of basement topography and an uneven sedimemt layer on off-axis, hydrothermal circulation through oceanic seciments and crust in a variety of settings. The investigators will cast the general problem in curvilinear coordinates and use the intergrated finite difference approach to problems of coupled heat and fluid flow. They will establish the relative importance of bathymetric amplitude and wavelength, crustal permeability structure, sediment thickness and uniformity, background heat flow, and the presence of discontinuous, impermeable sediment layers in determining the depth, geometry, and intensity of fluid fluxes away from the ridge axis.\n",

The system will be attached to a mass spectrometer in the Department of Geosciences at the Pennsylvania State University. The University will provide the remaining funds for the project. The micro-sampling system will permit oxygen isotope analysis of sub-milligram samples and the in situ study of isotope gradients on the millimeter scale. The improved micro- sampling system will be applied to the isotopic analysis of diamonds and other mantle-derived minerals.\n",
      "a9003490 MCB $40000 In the series of reactions comprising a metabolic sequence in cells or living organism, one central question has long concerned biochemists. Is a metabolite which is the product of one enzymic reaction and the substrate for a succeeding enzymic reaction formed and acted upon in a complex of the two proteins or is it produced in the first system and then dissociated into the surrounding medium to be captured and utilized by the second? This problem will be attacked in two ways: (a) by the use of dynamic light scattering to study the diffusional properties of the components of the system singly and together and by attempting to stabilize the presumptive complex of the two proteins through photochemical cross-linking. The two systems studied will be the glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase and lactate dehydrogenase two enzymes which have as a common metabolite, nicotinic-adenine-dinucleotide.\n",
      "a9003498 DMS $220100 Gaffney, Le and Massey will continue their study of the singularities of complex analytic spaces and mappings. Gaffney will investigate the equisingularity of families of mappings using analytic invariants, extending his results to C- zero finitely determined germs, and he will continue to develop an infinitesimal theory of Whitney equisingularity using integral closure operations. With Massey, he will investigate the correct generalizations of the Le cycles to the complete intersection case. Using blowing up operations, he will study the topology of maps between low dimensional spaces. Le will investigate the relation between algebraic depth and rectified homotopical depth, continuing his study of Lefschetz type theorems for singular spaces. Le also plans to give a new proof of the Le-Ramanujam theorem using vector fields, and he plans to study the canonical decomposition of the local monodromy of complex hypersurfaces and its links with the resolution of singularities and the geometry of polars. Massey will investigate questions concerning a topologically invariant decomposition of a constructible function, the Euler characteristic of the Milnor fibre of f-f(p) at p, and the related question of how the sheaf of vanishing cycles of a map decomposes as a perverse sheaf. The machinery of the derived category should allow for a powerful attack on the structure of non-isolated hypersurface singularities. Understanding singular spaces is important for realistic models of physical phenomena. Perhaps the most widely known singularity is the cosmologists' \"big bang.\"\n",

      "a9003509 CHE $222300 The goal of this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program is the synthesis and characterization of a wide variety of new fluorine-containing nitrogen and/or phosphorus compounds. It is expected that the presence of fluorine will endow the new compounds with desirable properties, such as special high temperature stabilities and concommitant high densities and long liquid ranges, compared to nonfluorinated analogs. The target compounds for synthesis are in three families: (A) fluorinated cyclophosphazenes and polyphosphazenes; (B) fluorinated tetrazoles and other tetraza-5-membered ring systems; and (C) fluorinated high-nitrogen compounds. Many of the new compounds will be synthesized by procedures analogous to those used for nonfluorinated analogs, but using fluorinated starting materials. In other cases fluorination will be accomplished with either carbonyl fluoride or trifluoroamine oxide. The new compounds will be characterized by a variety of spectroscopic methods and by x-ray and electron diffraction structural techniques.\n",
      "a9003513 ECS $109831 This program will address novel neural network models,for distributed stochastic operations. Distributed stochastic operations arise in a number of interesting systems, such as: (1) Multisensor target tracking, (2) Distributed and hierarchical decision making in organization structures, (3) Distributed and cooperative computer data processing, and (4) Global forecasting of economy factors in complex distributed systems. The neural network modeling of such systems is highly important, since it can dictate appropriate operations to be executed and important factors to be extracted and communicated, for effective system operation with simultaneously reduced complexity. Such modeling may also assist in the understanding of the basic elementary features and processes in complex systems as the above. The P.I. considers neural network structures whose objective is either hypothesis testing or parameter estimation. She will test specific approaches for the design and analysis of such networks, with performance criteria matching to the environment the network operates in and its objectives. The P.I. will also investigate new adaptive network training algorithms, with superior robustness and convergence characteristics. These algorithms outperform far the popular Least Mean Squares (LMS) algorithm, using error criteria that are more relevant than the minimum mean square error for the classification of patterns.\n",

The PI will convene a panel of senior individuals to review applications for support, and awards will be made with the following priority: (1) graduate students who are presenting papers, (2) researchers less than five years from the PhD who are presenting papers, and (3) other researchers having a proven record of productivity in the area and who can justify a genuine need for travel assistance.\n",
      "a9003518 ECS $239993 A specific objective is to extend the state-of-the-art of the numerical modeling of lattice-matched heterojunction semiconductor devices to strained-layer (pseudomorphic) heterojunction semiconductor devices for high speed and/or high frequency applications. Over the last three years, we have modeled A1GaAs/GaAs and InGaAs/InA1AsHBTs. Using a finite difference drift-diffusion equations (DDE) solver and numerical small-signal a.c. analysis, terminal characteristics as well as fT and fmax of these devices have been simulated. In view of recent interest in strained-layer semiconductors, it is natural to extend our current research to the modeling of HBTs involving strained layers. Focus will be placed on Si1-x Gex/Si and InxGa1-x As/GaAs systems. The basic heterojunction structures to be modeled are vertical devices having strained double heterojunctions with either emitter-top or collector-top configurations. The Monte Carlo method will be used to determine fundamental material properties, e.g. mobility, different coupling constants needed for proper modeling of non- stationary effects such as overshoot, and to perform full regional analysis of selected regions where these effects are suspected to be taking place, e.g. in the base-collector region of an HBT. In the next step, calculations will be performed using hydrodynamic equations obtained from the first three moments of the Boltzmann transport equation with the transport coefficients derived form the MC data. The results of these calculations will enable us to calculate both steady state d.c. and small-signal a.c. parameters, ranging from current gain to fT and fmax. Simulation results will be compared with either published data or with actual device measurements to be carried out in collaboration with researchers of the IBM Corporation. It is hoped that this research will bring heterojunctions advantages to today's well developed silicon technology and also take GaAs technology one step further in the race for the fastest semiconductor device.\n",
      "a9003524 DMS $44300 The principal investigator will conduct research into Riemannian manifolds with positive Ricci curvature and harmonic maps between spheres. He will investigate as to whether products of two closed 1-connected manifolds must have positive Ricci curvature when each has such curvature. And he will investigate the problem of whether closed 1-connected 5-manifolds carry metrics with positive Ricci curvature. The study of differential geometry has focused on problems concerning curvature for over a century. Today there are several competing notions of curvature including sectional, Gauss, and Ricci. Recently, in collaboration, the principal investigator constructed a complete Riemannian manifold with positive Ricci curvature which did not have non-negative sectional curvature. In this project he will study related questions for hypersurfaces of dimension four and five.\n",
      "a9003527 MCB $35000 Dr. Schepartz proposes to use a new technique - protein affinity cleavage - to analyze the mechanism of protein folding. The method requires the synthesis of bifunctional molecules which contain a protein-cleaving reagent covalently tethered to a protein-binding ligand. Once the ligand is bound the hydroxyl radical is loosed to allow cleavage in the neighborhood of the active site. Analysis of the sites of peptide cleavage will help elucidate the active site and surround to a resolution of single amino acids. It is claimed to be superior in this regard to other techniques, such as affinity labeling experiments. The results from this study promise to provide evidence for this claim and should give interesting data on the peptidy-prolyl isomerase enzymes which will be studied.\n",
      "a9003529 CMS $20000 This research program is part of the initiative to collect perishable data resulting from the 17 October 1989 Northern California (Loma Prieta) earthquake. It was observed that the specific geotechnical conditions at a site and the thickness of the soft soil deposits had a significant influence on the distribution of damage and apparent intensity of shaking during the earthquake. Immediately following the earthquake, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) undertook the installation, in the most severely damaged areas of San Francisco and Oakland, of strong motion instruments on the ground surface and in deep boreholes on top of bedrock. Undisturbed soil samples were recovered from all the significant geologic units within the soil profile during the drilling operations. These samples contain information that can be used to perform full dynamic site response analyses for both post-mortem investigations of the site response, and for prediction of the future response to strong ground shaking. The objective of this study is to obtain this information through appropriate classification tests and dynamic response tests performed on these soil samples, and to combine this information with in-situ shear wave velocity measurements obtained by the USGS: this will result in a full description of the dynamic response characteristics of the soil deposit. The results are to be presented as a report containing the complete stress-strain data as well as the derived modulus and damping ratio as a function of strain.\n",

      "a9003539 ECS $29900 Experimental and theoretical investigations of possible mechanisms of backflow of information in neurons are proposed. Such retrograde flow of information is a crucial aspect of learning and plasticity of neural networks involving backpropagation. The experimental preparations to be used are hippocampal slices of the rat brain. Evidence of retrograde pathways of informational flow other than membrane electrical potentials will be sought. One stimulus will be mechanical compression of efferent axons or axon hillocks. Changes in synaptic response at the dendritic and axonal levels will be monitored as evidence of backpropagation. The time scale of interest will be milliseconds as opposed to slower processes of axonal cytoplasmic flow in either direction. If functional plasticity is demonstrated, electron- microscopic examination of synapses will be made to seek cytoskeletal or vesicle alterations that correlate with the functional changes. Theoretical models will consist of cytoskeletal components of actin-myosin gel, microtubular structure and a viscoelastic matrix representing cytoplasm. An active tension will be assumed in the actin-myosin gel. Possible modes of wave propagation in the composite structure will be investigated. The significance of the proposed research will be very important of correlation of biological counterparts to theoretical models of neural networks.\n",
      "a9003540 DBI $43920 Professor Schatz is undertaking a one-year investigation to understand and outline the design of a computer system to support an electronic scientific community. While later proposals will be submitted to support the system, this project is to lay the necessary groundwork to enable the implementation to proceed as planned. When implemented, this system should be a new form of biological instrumentation which can effectively manipulate scientific databases. Appropriate community knowledge will be identified to be collected into a digital library and the design will incorporate the systems technology necessary to manipulate this library over nationwide networks. The community chosen is the group of scientists studying the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, a major model organism in molecular biology. The \"worm community\" consists of some 500 members worldwide, with an unusual degree of open communication and sharing of unpublished information. The community knowledge includes formal data, such as published literature and experimental results, and informal data, such as newsletters and experimental methods. The designed system will capture a significant portion of this knowledge in electronic form and encode it into a \"worm information space\" which can be transparently browsed by scientists anywhere on nationwide scientific networks. Preparation of the system design requires understanding user needs and available technology. this will be accomplished by working with researchers who will be the system's initial users and who are experts on the available data and technology. Such investigation should enable the design to ensure that the system will contribute to making valuable scientific discoveries.\n",
      "a9003542 CHE $280000 Modern solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy offers the chemist one of the most powerful tools available for the study of the physical and chemical properties of materials. Fundamental knowledge of structure and dynamics of materials as diverse as biopolymers, resins, coals, and liquid crystals is accessible by solid-state NMR techniques. Solid-state NMR studies often complement those carried out using solution NMR and X-ray analysis. Access to solid-state NMR is rapidly becoming essential to chemists carrying out frontier research. This award from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program and the Instrumentation for Materials Research Program will help the Department of Chemistry at the University of California in Santa Barbara, to acquire a high-field NMR spectrometer suitable for carrying out solid-state NMR studies. The areas of chemical research that will be enhanced by the acquisition include the following: Structural Characterization of Non-Oxidic Glasses by Modern Solid State NMR Techniques.

      "a9003543 DMS $38207 This work will be concerned principally with the analysis of classes of second order partial differential equations or partial integrodifferential equations describing time-dependent phenomena. In certain cases, good approximations to the solutions can be obtained by discarding the highest order time derivative in the equation. Work will be done in justifying such approximations by considering the effects of sending the highest time derivative to zero. For the short time behavior, one obtains a singular perturbation problem in which transient phenomena governed by a related equation should occur on a fast time scale. For the long time behavior, regular dependence of the time-asymptotic limit or - in cases of severe non-uniqueness of stationary states - selection effects from the transient behavior are expected. In this project, efforts will be made to place some of these heuristic conjectures on a mathematically sound basis. Work will also be done on questions of existence of solutions for the reduced problems. Sources for the equations under study include mathematical models describing shear flows for viscoelastic materials and polymerrheology.\n",
      "a9003544 MCB $280000 The intent of this study is to identify the macromolecules involved in the regulation of microtubule assembly during the interphase-to- mitosis transition in developing sea urchin embryos. Unfertilized sea urchin eggs are arrested at G1 of the first mitotic cycle and have few, if any assembled microtubules despite a large pool of tubulin subunits. Following fertilization microtubules of the first cleavage mitotic apparatus are synchronously assembled. Therefore the developing sea urchin embryo can be viewed as an inducible model system for studying the regulation of microtubule assembly. It has been recently discovered that interphase-arrested egg cells contain two novel inhibitors of microtubule assembly- a minus-end inhibitor and a pH-dependent plus-end inhibitor. The goal of the proposed research is to isolate and characterize these unique factors during the cell cycle. Preliminary experiments with such diverse sources as sea urchin eggs, surf clam oocytes, mouse B16 cultured melanoma cells, squid optic lobe and mammalian brain tissue suggest that these negative control factors may exist in all eukaryotic cells, particularly where cytoplasmic microtubules are rapidly assembled and disassembled in a controlled manner during the cell cycle. The interconversion of mitotic and interphase microtubule arrays during the cell cycle is a fundamental problem of cellular morphogenesis. The process is of obvious importance for cell division but also for developmental processes such as neuronal growth and plasticity. These studies are expected to increase our understanding of fundamental mechanisms whereby microtubule assembly is regulated in the living cell.\n",
      "a9003549 EAR $35830 This award is for the support of an instrument development project at the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism of the Carnegie Institution of Washington. A laser resonance ionization source mass spectrometer is being developed for the purpose of measuring Os isotopic ratios and Re and Os concentrations in natural samples via the isotope dilution method. Currently, the laser ionization of Re and Os takes place in an atom cloud above the sample that is produced by pulsed tantalum filament heating. The relatively slow thermal pulse of the filament compared to the short duration of the pulsed laser causes premature depletion of the atom cloud and limits the ultimate accuracy of the instrument. The goal of this project is to improve the ion source system by incorporating a pulsed sputtering gun to replace the thermal source.\n",
      "a9003550 DMS $159942 This award will support research in the geometry of Banach spaces. In finite dimensions, all vector spaces are essentially the same. But in the infinite dimensional situation of interest here, this is far from the case. Banach spaces are infinite dimensional spaces with the additional structure introduced by varying notions of distance between points in the space. Such spaces have wide application in mathematics, both pure and applied. The particular problems which Professors Johnson and Pisier will address include the Lipschitz theory of finite metric spaces, operator theory and the factorization of operators, weak Hilbert spaces, probability theory, factorization of operator valued analytic functions, and completely bounded maps.\n",
      "a9003552 EAR $119600 The proposed research will focus on the mineralogic, and structural features preserved in gabbros and basalts of the Kap Edvard Holm, Nordre Aputiteq and Patulajivit complexes in order to characterize processes of elemental mass transfer related to hydrothermal metasomatism, stoping and assimilation during rifting in the North Atlantic. To achieve these goals we will address the following questions: 1) What are the cumulative effects of multiple intrusions on hydrothermal metasomatism and the evolution of porosity and permeability in gabbroic plutons and basaltic rocks? 2) How does hydrothermal metasomatism of host rocks affect subsequent mass transfer from host rocks to magma during stoping and assimilation? Completion of the research outlined in this proposal will provide a framework for understanding the geochemical and structural evolution of gabbro-hosted magma-hydrothermal systems during crustal rifting.\n",
      "a9003553 CHE $420000 This grant is in the general field of analytical and surface chemistry and in the subfield of reaction dynamics at gas metal interfaces. Professor W. Henry Weinberg of the University of California at Santa Barbara will continue his studies of the reactions of gases at well defined metal surfaces. The focus of the current work will be the understanding of the details of the promotion and poisoning of the dissociative adsorption reactions of nitrogen, oxygen and carbon dioxide at ruthenium surfaces. Further studies with more complex polyatomic molecules will also be done. Simulations of the reaction dynamics will be accomplished to determine the effects of specific reaction channels in the adsorption process. The results of this work will lead to an understanding of the factors governing catalytic reactions and the thermodynamics of reactions at the interface. Several related issues in reaction dynamics will be explored. Molecular beam chemistry with the Ru(001) interface will be explored with vibrational spectroscopy of the adsorbates, following the products of complex surface reactions. Local surface coverage effects will be explored by studying oxygen chemisorption on the Ru surface as a function of order in the monolayer. Surface temperature modulation will be used to follow the reaction coordinates and quantify the reaction rate coefficients of a branching unimolecular dissociation reaction. Monte Carlo simulations of second order surface reactions will explore compensation effects in kinetic parameters.\n",
      "a9003554 EAR $156431 Analyses of the published sulfur isotopic data on bulk rock samples of Archean sediments have led to a new model for the Archean atmosphere-ocean-biosphere system: the oceans, as far back as about 3.8-3.2 billion years ago, were already sulfate rich with a sulfate concentration of > about 1/3 of the present level, were 30- 40 oC warmer than modern oceans, and supported a very high activity of sulfate reducing bacteria world wide; the early Archean atmosphere already contained appreciable amounts of free oxygen. The objective of the proposed research is to test the above and other models for the Archean atmosphere-ocean-biosphere by examining the sulfur-carbon-iron chemistry and the microscopic- scale variation in the sulfur, carbon and oxygen isotopic compositions of sediments from the Warrawoona Group, Australia; the Isua Group, Greenland; and the Fig Tree Group, South Africa, using a state-of-the-art stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer equipped with a laser ablation system.\n",
      "a9003555 HRD $129266 This project will take a two-pronged approach to give greater insight into how signals are perceived and transduced into responses in plant cells. (1) Rhizobium bacteria induce the formation of nitrogen fixing nodules in plants and together they provide the major input of biologically fixed nitrogen in agriculture. Cellular and molecular biological methods will be brought to bear on the analysis of early events of nodulation (nod gene mechanisms) of root hairs in the Rhizobium meliloti-alfalfa system (with Sharon Long). A newly developed method will allow bacterial cells and purified \"nod factors\" to be applied to or injected into single root hair cells. Video- enhanced (including confocal laser scanning) light microscopic images will permit the in vivo observations of induced responses in nodulating root hair cells, and these images will be correlated with in vitro electron microscopic images. Transient and longer response changes in internal calcium ion levels, cytoskeletal elements, calmodulin and the endoplasmic reticulum will be examined. A clearer understanding of the cellular, genetic and molecular aspects of nodulation should result. (2) The photoreceptor phytochrome mediates a host of light-activated developmental processes in plants. Monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against phytochrome will be used to detect and localize (video microscopically) the distribution of the membrane-associated fractions of phytochrome in pea stem vesicles, and if that is successful, in cells (with Winslow Briggs). Interactive activities will consist of a course entitled Gender and Science, taught to undergraduate and graduate students from different disciplines in the sciences and humanities; lectures in a \"Microscopy for Biologists\" course on video-enhanced, computer-based microscopic methods; several seminars; and organization of informal panel discussions on several topics pertinent to women (and men) in science. This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering by providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers employed in industry, government, and academic institutions. By encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a valuable investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.\n",
      "a9003557 CMS $71000 This project focuses on lessons that can be learned following the October 17, 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake. The objective of the study is to conduct research on the cause and effects of fires initiated by the Loma Prieta earthquake. Specifically the following will be done: o Compile post-earthquake fire statistics in terms of type (electrical, gas or others) and correlate these statistics with the regional earthquake intensity (acceleration) data of the earthquake. o Conduct analytic studies to evaluate the chain of events leading to a fire after an earthquake, investigate the cause of fire and establish the probability of fire development in terms of a given earthquake intensity. o Use the Loma Prieta data and the analytic studies to develop risk of fires associated with future earthquakes and to investigate the design implementation of the calculated risk for hazard mitigation purposes. //\n",
      "a9003560 CMS $102600 This project addresses lessons that can be learned from the October 17, 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake. In most natural disasters, there is significant direct impact on human populations: specifically injuries and death result from the hazard itself, or as a result of the particular hazard's effect on the infrastructure. While advances in engineering have certainly lessened this impact over the past several decades, there are still many unanswered questions as to the precise cause and severity of injuries occurring during natural disasters. By applying techniques developed in the relatively new field of earthquake injury epidemiology, the research described in this proposal will enable a detailed epidemiologic study to be made of the injuries resulting from the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake in the County of Santa Cruz. Preliminary quick-response field reconnaissance - already performed - coupled with comprehensive follow-up data collection and interviews will enable a detailed accounting of all the injuries in the County resulting from the earthquake. This information will be of significant use for earthquake preparedness and hazard mitigation activities. In addition, collection of the data will enable the testing of the research methodology for application in future events.\n",
      "a9003563 CMS $43000 This is a post Loma Prieta earthquake (Oct. 1989) investigation project in learning from this damaging event. The objective of this project is to utilize the strong- motion records to validate and improve the current analytical methods for predicting the drift response of flat-plate buildings. It has been demonstrated repeatedly that discrepancies exist between the analytically predicted response and the actual response of flat-plate buildings. Because of their inherent flexibility, the survivability of flat- plate buildings very much depends upon controlled drift. A realistic estimate of lateral drift is therefore essential for a safe design. A number of flat-plate and flat-slab buildings, ranging in height from six to twenty stories, have yielded over twenty seconds of strong-motion data. Records from a selected number of these buildings will be collected for evaluation of drift response. Each building will be analyzed for lateral drift using the code defined lateral forces and the currently accepted analytical models. The analyses will then be repeated for time-history response using the ground motion recorded at the base of the buildings. By comparing the predicted and the measured response and using the system identification techniques, the reliability of the existing models for predicting the drift response of flat-plate buildings for an earthquake type of loading could be improved.\n",
      "a9003565 CMS $46499 This project addresses the lessons learned from the 17 October 1989 Northern California (Loma Prieta) earthquake. It follows a \"quick response\" award made to Dames and Moore for the collection of perishable data from the earthquake. The Loma Prieta earthquake affected the performance of virtually every type of lifeline in the San Francisco Bay Area, including natural gas systems. Natural gas systems were severely affected in areas of significant ground failure, such as in the Marina district, where several large fires erupted after the initial ground shock. There was concern that uncontrolled fires would be fueled by gas leaks in the area. Fortunately, the fires were contained by utilizing several alternative water sources. The aim of this project is to study the effects of the earthquake on local natural gas systems. Specifically it analyzes the data collected as part of the \"quick response\" award, in order to develop better seismic risk evaluation models for natural gas systems, and to determine whether existing safety devices, such as seismic shutoff valves, are a feasible solution for mitigating overall earthquake losses. An analysis of these data builds upon limited studies which already exist for these systems. A comparison of performance data from this event to similar data from the 1971 San Fernando and the 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquakes is critical in order to quantify differences in performance due to regional factors and level of earthquake preparedness.\n",
      "a9003568 CMS $83866 This project focuses upon lessons that can be learned from the Loma Prieta Earthquake of October 17, 1989. The project is a one-year comparative study of disaster impacts and initial community recovery activities in Charleston County, South Carolina and Santa Cruz County, California. These two counties, which are roughly comparable in population size, both recently sustained extensive damage in two major natural disasters, Hurricane Hugo (Charleston) and the Loma Prieta earthquake (Santa Cruz). The objectives of the study are to (1) document disaster impacts and early recovery issues and activities in the two communities; (2) develop a set of socio-economic indicators that can be used to chart disaster recovery, and begin collecting data on those indicators; and (3) conduct comparative analyses and develop hypotheses concerning factors that explain outcomes in the recovery period. Data for the study will come from archives, documents, community statistics, and other records, as well as from in- depth interviews with representatives of key organizations in both communities.\n",
      "a9003573 CMS $144000 This project focuses on lessons that can be learned from the October 17, 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake. The proposed research deals with the economic and social aspects of the Loma Prieta earthquake, focusing on earthquake insurance issues, impacts of the earthquake on the behavior of individuals, and changes in perception of the earthquake hazard following the earthquake. It involves a re-survey of California homeowners whose attitudes towards the earthquake hazard and insurance purchase decisions were assessed in May of 1989, as well as a supplemental survey of residents of Santa Clara county. In this project, the impacts of this earthquake on shifts in attitudes towards earthquake hazards in general and the purchase of earthquake insurance in particular will be tested as well as the impact of geographic location of the household with respect to recent property damage on subsequent insurance purchase.\n",

This data will be inverted along with other geodetic data available in the region to determine a coseismic slip model of the Loma Prieta earthquake. GPS monitoring will continue on an approximately quarterly basis to detect any post-seismic slip on the San Andreas or adjacent faults. This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.\n",
      "a9003579 CMS $65000 This is a post Loma Prieta earthquake (Oct. 1989) investigation project in learning from this damaging event. The focus of this project is to study the effects of pounding of adjacent structures against each other based on the actual damage observations. The objectives are: (1) to survey the frequency and types of pounding that occurred, (2) to evaluate analytically the effects of pounding on several buildings that had observed structural damage from pounding, (3) to investigate the adverse effects of pounding, and (4) to provide engineers with guidance to mitigate the damage from pounding. The expected research results: a summary of observed damage due to pounding, and analytical investigation to correlate with actual observed pounding damage, a proposed modeling procedure and a design method for buildings subjected to pounding, and a method of mitigating pounding damage on existing adjacent buildings. This study will lead to a better understanding of the phenomena and proper ways to mitigate the damages in connection with pounding.\n",
      "a9003581 CMS $27347 This project addresses the lessons learned from the 17 October 1989 Northern California (Loma Prieta) earthquake. It addresses the seismic performance of tieback retaining walls. Tieback retaining walls are commonly used for the temporary support of excavations for building construction. These types of support systems are typically designed on the basis of empirical experience with little, if any, thought given to seismic design requirements. Questions regarding the seismic performance of these types of structures are becoming more important with the increasing use of these walls for the permanent support of excavation cuts. While earthquake-related failures of tieback walls have not been reported in the literature, it is not clear if this fortunate circumstance is due to a conservative (but expensive) design practice, or to the limited number of cases where these types of walls have been subjected to earthquake ground motions. The aim of this project is to enhance the current state-of-the-art in the seismic design of tieback retaining walls by reviewing the performance of existing walls - both temporary and permanent - in the San Francisco Bay area that were subjected to the ground shaking from the Loma Prieta earthquake. Particular emphasis is given to tieback walls constructed with the \"soil nailing\" technique, which is relatively new in the United States. Available information on the horizontal displacement of the walls and/or load increases in the tiebacks within the walls, and on any damage experienced, is studied; these data are compared to the general design practice for these types of walls. The benefit of this research is that it will improve the state of the engineering practice in the design of permanent tieback walls. This should facilitate the widespread use of tieback retaining walls in areas of high seismicity, leading to a safer and more economical design.\n",
      "a9003583 CMS $93424 This project addresses the lessons learned from the 17 October 1989 Northern California (Loma Prieta) Earthquake. The objective is to evaluate the state-of- the-art analytical techniques for analyzing soil-pile foundation-structure interaction during earthquake shaking, in order to improve the understanding of this phenomenon, and to verify and calibrate existing techniques. This is achieved by analyzing the response of a 30 story building in Emeryville, California, using various techniques for analyzing soil-pile-structure interaction under seismic loading. The building is a ductile moment resisting space frame and wall structure supported by a 5 foot thick concrete mat with 900 14 by 14 inch concrete piles. It is instrumented with strong motion recording instruments which successfully recorded the building motions during the Loma Prieta earthquake (USGS Rep.89-568, 1989): the ground motions adjacent to the building were also recorded. This investigation involves a collaboration with the United States Geological Survey (USGS).\n",
      "a9003588 CMS $57428 This project addresses the lessons learned from the 17 October 1989 Northern California (Loma Prieta) earthquake. The aim is to evaluate critical parameters of the Loma Prieta earthquake ground motions (including after shocks) that have engineering significance, and to demonstrate the use of these parameters in predicting the damageability of future Bay Area earthquakes. Information on the duration, time-variation and breadth of frequency content, cyclic history, etc. - motion properties known to have important effects on structural damage, but which are difficult to define and use explicitly - this information is incorporated implicitly in the characterization. A comparison is made between the predicted and observed damage-effective motion characteristics for the Loma Prieta earthquake. The observed analytical characterizations are used to explain specific cases of building damage and non- damage, while the influence of the soil on the motion characterizations is determined statistically. These data from the Loma Prieta earthquake are combined with data computed for earlier events. The project is expected to result in improved statistical formulas for the magnitude/distance/soil dependence of nonlinear damageability. These formulas, when combined with local soils data, are used to conduct probabilistic hazard analyses to derive maps of the damageability of future Bay Area earthquakes.\n",

This projects will study the damage and document the museum contents losses during the earthquake in terms of both value and failure mode. Several critical museums will be selected and their site- specific art object/support system response criteria will be determined from the recorded ground motions. The response criteria and damage survey will then be used to develop recommendations for future seismic loss mitigation measures for museum contents. This study will improve our ability to reduce the losses of museums in their irreplaceable collections due to earthquakes.\n",
      "a9003598 CMS $86513 The Loma Prieta earthquake of October 17, 1989, had a Richter magnitude of 7.1 and caused billions of dollars in damage throughout the San Francisco Bay region and in Santa Cruz County. As part of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program (NEHRP) various Federal, state and regional programs have been carried out in past years to promote the implementation of local-level earthquake preparedness and loss reduction activities. The Loma Prieta earthquake provides the opportunity to examine the specific lessons local agency staff have learned through having their preparedness plans and loss reduction programs tested by a major earthquake in the region. Agency staff selected from approximately 35 jurisdictions in seven Bay region counties will be asked whether their mitigation efforts were effective or were likely to be effective in future earthquakes, whether the earthquake has caused them to change their pre-quake programs and plans, and what information sources and program guidance they now think are the most useful. The implications of the findings for setting local-level priorities for mitigation activities, and for the design of Federal, state and regional programs to foster local level hazard mitigation activities are addressed.\n",
      "a9003600 CMS $86994 This is a post Loma Prieta earthquake (Oct. 1989) investigation project in learning from this damaging event. The gist of this project is to study the effect of rocking motion of the earthquake to the structural response. The rocking component of ground motion is generally considered to be small in magnitude and therefore its effects are neglected. There are however certain situations where the combined conditions of structures, site location, and earthquake motions are such that the rocking component becomes important. In this project, the damage distribution will be studied to determine where the rocking motion contributed to the damages of the buildings which were not designed to account for these additional effects. Geology and soil data of the entire bay area will be used to estimate the rocking motion contributions at various sites based on the recorded translation motions. The generated data will then be used to analyze different structures for rocking response. This study will enable engineers to determine rationally the importance of rocking motion in the seismic safety of structures designed with or without consideration of such additional earthquake forces.\n",
      "a9003602 CMS $47938 This is a post Loma Prieta earthquake (Oct. 1989) investigation project in learning from this damaging event. The thrust of this project is to evaluate the performance of university buildings located at the campus of the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF) from the damage observations and seismic behavior analysis. The UCSF campus has gradually grown over the years to now encompass 80 buildings located throughout San Francisco. As such the campus exhibits a wide range of building types and standards and, in addition, strong motion records are available for this site from the California Division of Mines and Geology, thus making it ideally suited for this evaluation. Several buildings of different types will be chosen for detailed evaluations. Evaluation methods from the Applied Technology Council ATC-14 document will be employed to perform consistent, realistic, cost effective assessments of the performance during the Loma Prieta earthquake of the existing buildings against their standards of record. Observed damage, causes of any failures, likely building responses, actual and potential life-safety hazards, and capacity/demand margins for the Loma Prieta and future earthquakes with respect to UCSF buildings will be identified and discussed. These findings will be extended to behavior of university buildings in general with respect to their standard code of record in a final report to be issued at project completion. The building stock of a variety of construction types and ages will enable the seismic performance of older buildings be evaluated and the associated generic potential life-safety hazards be rectified.\n",
      "a9003606 BCS $4649 With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Barbara Stark will conduct sourcing analysis of ca. 174 obsidian artifacts recovered from archaeological contexts in the Veracruz region of Mexico. In the course of previous NSF funded research, Dr. Stark has examined the prehistory of this small region located on the Gulf coast of Mexico. In contrast to the central highlands region, Veracruz never developed into a large and powerful state but rather was characterized by smaller polities. Dr. Stark, therefore, looked at Veracruz as a marginal area and wished to discover how it interacted with and was affected by these more powerful states. Because obsidian (volcanic glass) makes excellent stone tools which hold a sharp edge, it was highly prized in antiquity and was widely traded. It is also of interest to archaeologists because its distribution in Middle America is highly localized and the number of sources small. Individual sources are chemically distinct, and through trace element analysis it is possible to match obsidian artifact with its geological source. On this basis it is possible to trace the movement of obsidian, to reconstruct economic patterns, and in turn to gain insight into the changing political landscape. In this project, the University of Missouri will conduct neutron activation analysis on a series of obsidian artifacts from a number of Veracruz sites. Through these, interactions with larger central Mexican states can be reconstructed. This research is important because it will increase our understanding of how the complex societies characteristic of many portions of the world develop and are maintained. It will also allow the maximum amount of information to be obtained from an already successful project.\n",
      "a9003608 CHE $406120 This research is being funded by the Organic Synthesis Chemistry Program. The synthesis of the complex new substances required by our society in a cost effective manner is the goal of this research. This is a daunting challenge that requires considerable insight and ingenuity to accomplish. Nature is replete with organic compounds of intricate molecular structure. Often these materials may be isolated from their natural sources in quantity; more often they cannot. The alternative to isolation is synthesis--laboratory manufacture from commonly available materials. Although chemists have over the last half-century become rather adept at constructing small amounts of very complicated molecules, they generally cannot prepare most desired organic compounds in an efficient, practical, and cost-effective manner. This general inability to conceive and execute practical laboratory syntheses constitutes a frailty of our science. It is the long-term goal of this research to address this deficiency by inventing new strategies for the laboratory synthesis of complex organic structures. The compounds to be synthesized are molecules of nature--alkaloids and polyisoprenoids. The intent is not just to make a compound, but to do it in a way that will lead to something new about the architectural aspect of molecule-building. The constant goals are: (a) to minimize the required number of tranformations by eschewing protective groups whenever possible, (b) to minimize the required number of transformations by finding ways in which \"cascades\" of reactions can occur under the same reaction conditions, (c) to simplify the total synthesis process by using, to the extent possible, \"low-tech\", rather than exotic, expensive reagents. The specific systems to be studied are: petrosin, sarain-A, nominine, aristone, dictyoxetane, velutinal, crinipellin A and members of the daphniphyllum alkaloid family.\n",
      "a9003611 INT $198148 This award will support development of an interactive multimedia program for the teaching of Japanese to English speaking scientists and engineers. The materials will be contextually grounded in situations and settings relevant to individuals going to Japan for the purpose of collaborative research. The learner will be exposed to interactions, characters, and scenarios in much the same way that she/he would experience these occurrences: randomly (as the video proceeds forward inviting the user to stop and select various options) or selectively (as action attracts interest). Interspersed with the \"events\" in a simulation will be a wide variety of linguistic exercises based on the core conversa- tions of the textbook, Japanese: The Spoken Language, by Jorden and Noda (Yale University Press). Users will be able to selectively access linguistic and cultural background information far more detailed than what is currently available in any textbook. There is a critical need for more effective communications between American and Japanese researchers. This project will help to address that need by integrating state-of-the art technology with sound principles of language pedagogy to produce a multimedia- based program of Japanese language instruction oriented to scientists and engineers.\n",
      "a9003613 BCS $92224 An important insight about substances such as gold and glass is that each substance is made up of a unique kind of tiny homogeneous particle. While adults generally share this belief, little is known about how it develops as a child matures. It is crucial to develop this concept in order to make sense of the behavior of various substances and to predict that behavior in everyday life as well as in science classes. For instance, this concept can help children appreciate that matter can exist as invisible particles and maintain its inherent, and in some cases potent, properties; that the inherent properties of an aggregate- -e.g., whether it is safe to touch, eat, inhale--depends more on the nature of its constituent particles than on its gross appearance. This project will chart systematically how this important concept develops by examining whether children think that a substance maintains its identity and inherent properties despite dramatic changes in its chunk or grain size. Identity refers to membership of a certain material kind (e.g., sugar); inherent properties are chemical properties described in ways that even young children can understand (e.g., smells good when it burns); and size can vary from a large chunk to smaller pieces, powder, or even invisible particles. This project will also examine whether this concept helps children appreciate that a substance such as sugar can continue to exist--in tiny homogeneous particles--even after it has become invisible upon dissolution. A third goal is to explore how this concept may be related to the way children and adults generalize what they have learned about one sample of a substance to another sample of the same substance. Discoveries of links among different aspects of children's understanding of matter can inform us about the nature of children's theories of matter. Such discoveries can enrich our understanding of how children and adults develop intuitive theories about the world. Science educators can also make use of such discoveries to develop curricula that young children can understand and from which they can learn.\n",

      "a9003633 EAR $47757 This project will investigate the genesis of repetitive, self- organization patterns of texture and composition in volcanic agates. These patterns are believed to be interlinked. Self- organization of a non-equilibrium system involves the spontaneous generation of a repetitive pattern without preexisting structures or periodic outside causes. The main patterns to be explored are (a) the systematic interlayering of bands made up of twisted chalcedony fibers with bands consisting of non-twisted fibers, (b) the associated oscillatory minor-element profile predicted by our present model and revealed by cathodoluminescence, and (c) the systematically fibrous, length-fast habit of agate quartz. The proposed research consists of quantitative dynamical modeling of agate crystallization by an autocatalytic mechanism, morphological instability analysis of the crystallization front, microscopic observations, and trace- and minor-element analyses by ion probe. These analyses will be carried out with the NSF-funded ion probe at MIT. This project will clarify the dynamics of a self- organizing system with geochemical, crystallochemical, and petrological significance, and geochemical factors controlling crystal morphology and crystalline textures.\n",

      "a9003646 EAR $80000 This research will analyze the October 17, 1989, Loma Prieta, California, earthquake source mechanism by comparison with the great 1906 San Francisco earthquake which ruptured the San Andreas fault in the same segment. One of the most interesting and unexpected aspects of the Loma Prieta earthquake is that the mechanism indicated by preliminary results has a significant thrust component (about 1/2 the total) which suggests an uplift of about 1 meter. If the oblique-slip mechanism is characteristic of the events occurring along this segment, we would expect a long-term uplift rate of 1 cm/year, which appears much higher than inferred from the regional geomorphology. The seismograms from the 1906 event will be analyzed to look for the presence of a similar thrust component. This research is a contribution to the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.\n",
      "a9003654 CMS $112782 This is a post Loma Prieta earthquake (Oct. 1989) investigation project in learning from this damaging event. The project will focus on the study of performance of unreinforced masonry buildings (UMR) during the earthquake. Response of selected structures will be estimated using computational models, and correlated with expectations of structural strength and observations of damage. The study will encompass buildings located in the counties of Alameda, Monterey, Santa Clara, Santa Cruz and San Francisco. Both damaged and undamaged structures will be considered. The study will include a wide variety of masonry element types including structural walls resisting forces within and normal to their plane, infill panels in either steel or concrete frames, cladding, parapets, and other nonstructural elements. Both engineered and nonengineered construction will be studied. Candidate structures will be selected for investigation based on degree of damage, expected force level, location, soil conditions, and availability of information on ground motions and structural descriptions. It is expected that knowledge gained will be helpful for mitigating the earthquake hazard in the eastern USA because of the widespread use of unreinforced masonry in those regions of a potential moderate intense earthquake.\n",

The structure of the luciferin will be determined, and the mechanism of light-emitting reaction will be investigated from various angles. The luciferin might be useful as a 02 indicator. (2) Bioluminescence of euphausiids and dinoflagellates: Tetrapyrroles play key roles in both bioluminescence systems, but in different manners. In the euphausiid system, the fluorescent substance F (a tetrapyrrole) catalyzes the aerobic oxidation of a photoprotein. In the dinoflagellate system, luciferin (a tetrapyrrole) is oxidized into oxyluciferin in the presence of a luciferase. Despite the apparent difference, both systems may involve the same basic chemistry The reactions involved will be investigated to clarify the mechanisms of light emission. The oxidizable group of the euphausiid photoprotein will be determined.\n",
      "a9003687 DMR $100000 This research is concerned with the application of various diffusing-wave-spectroscopic probes to the study of the dynamics of dense colloidal suspensions. Light scattering experiments will be carried out on well controlled particles suspensions. The primary aim of the work is to explore basic scientific issues connected with: 1) the dynamics and structure of strongly interacting, dense colloidal suspensions, and 2) the transport of light dense random media. The secondary goals concern advancing diffusing-wave-spectroscopic measurement technology and attempts to apply the technique to more complex systems. It is anticipated the research will improve our understanding of the roles played by hydrodynamic and electrostatic interactions in affecting particle dynamics and structure.\n",
      "a9003688 EAR $57700 Manganese-rich, aluminum-poor modulated layer silicate minerals are to be studied by using an integrated petrologic and mineralogic approach to assess structural stability. This study will determine if the misfit between the ideal sheets of tetrahedra and octahedra is a requirement to produce a modulated layer silicate structure. In addition, the Grenfell deposit, Australia, will be studied to determine the effect of sequential metamorphism on the mineral phases. The work will be done in collaboration with Dr. R.A. Eggleton of the Australian National University, the Canberra. Using ultra-high resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction techniques.\n",
      "a9003692 MCB $49779 This application proposes an international cooperation among three American and three Soviet laboratories. The scientific objective is to define the relative movements between myosin subfragment 1 (S-1) and actin (in complex) under the influence of ATP hydrolysis going on in S-1. These movements, underlying muscle contraction and some cell motility, are thought to accomplish energy transduction (free energy of ATP hydrolysis to mechanical (force x distance) work). Optically-detected molecular probes are to be used in pairs, either to detect correlated re-orientation or to detect change in scalar distances, the purpose being to decide whether the movements in transduction are a global rotation of S-1 caused by very small internal displacements (present \"standard model\") or whether internal movements encompass most of S-1 (as in interdomain movement). Efforts will be made---using differential scanning calorimetry circular dichroism---to obtain indications of domain structure, and also to examine the effect of crosslinks on the putative movements of these domains. Attempts also will be made to develop both physical (S-1 on oriented pure F-actin) and molecular graphic models in order to simplify the foregoing studies. Besides the six senior investigators, several students and young associates would participate in this work. The principal significance of this proposal is basic. Since no biological energy transducer has yet been explained, the possibility of discovering design features also may be of practical interest.\n",
      "a9003693 DMS $13792 Statistical research on problems in semiparametric inference will be conducted with most relating to survival analysis and several with a sequential nature. Sequential tests will be constructed for the relative-scale parameter based on survival analysis data with censoring in a two-sample accelerated-life model. The model is semiparametric in that the relative scale parameter is a parametric component while the baseline distribution is a nonparametric component. Sequential effective score tests will be developed for this problem as an alternative to sequential logrank tests. More general versions of this will also be analyzed. Estimation will also be studied in accelerated- life models with censored data. The settings will include the study of elapsed time in sequential clinical trials on survival data, inference for bivariate models induced by frailties, inference for proportional-mean-residual-life models, weighted U- statistics in semiparametric models, large-sample \"completeness\", and sequential stopping rules for Monte Carlo tests.\n",
      "a9003694 DMS $39260 The focus of this work will be the study of monotonicity and symmetry properties of solutions of partial differential equations. Equations of interest include those arising in modeling vibrations and in nonlinear Schrodinger equations. They fall into the classes known as fully nonlinear elliptic and parabolic equations. One is interested in understanding solutions where the minimal period is prescribed or the nature of the singularity where a solution ceases to exist (blow up). Progress in the first case has been made; the major obstacle to be overcome rests with the complexity of the infinite dimensional kernel of the wave operator. Development in the study of blow up of solutions of the Schrodinger equation have advanced considerably in the past decade. It has been shown that when the spatial domain is star-shaped, solutions do blow up in finite time. Work will continue in this vein to understand better the nature of the singularity and to obtain sharper estimates regarding the time at which the blow up can be expected. Currently, many related estimates are very crude. The onset of blow up is not yet known to have physical significance because the minimal possible time may be exponentially large. Other work will investigate the existence, uniqueness and spatial decay properties of solutions of traveling waves arising from dynamics and combustion problems.\n",
      "a9003695 DBI $524194 Gel electrophoresis has been used to fractionate macromolecules for studies in all fields of biochemistry and biophysics. To understand mechanisms of sieving during gel electrophoresis, the PIs have previously qualified sieving and tested several models of sieving by gels. Two models, one based on sterics and one and based on hydrodynamics, have survived these tests. During previous studies, sieving for spheres with radii between 5 and 500 nm has been qualified; an analysis of the sieving of rods has been started; the structure of gels has been investigated. The objectives of the present proposal are to: (1) determine the model that most accurately describes the sieving of spheres during gel electrophoresis; video light microscopy (phase contrast and fluorescent) of individual spheres undergoing gel electrophoresis will be performed; (2) determine how sieving depends on the structure of the gel used for electrophoresis; sieving will be quantified by use of procedures of gel electrophoresis previously developed by the PIs; the structure of gels will be determined in part by use of electron microscopy and computer-assisted image processing; (3) determine the effect on sieving of the dimensions and flexibility of rod-shaped particles; for this purpose, one of the PIs' procedures of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis will be used; (4) obtain and organize for rapid access a catalogue of conditions appropriate for sieving-based separation and characterization of particles with effective radii as small as 1- 2 nm and as large as 5-10 nm. The research proposed will contribute to the understanding of motion through porous networks in both biological and non-biological systems. This research will also increase the capacity for rapid and inexpensive biophysical characterization of particles that need not be purified.\n",
      "a9003698 DMR $98250 Theoretical studies will be conducted on random networks with particular emphasis on disordered superconductors and quantum systems. The connection between percolation and superconductivity will be addressed for networks of Josephson junctions and for networks of thin wires governed by Ginzburg- Landau order parameters. Also, studies will be conducted on the random walk method for calculating transport properties such as the Hall coefficient at the percolation threshold.\n",
      "a9003700 EAR $24975 The Avalon composite terrane of the northern Appalachian orogen represent a college of tectonostratigraphic terranes that were amalgamated in the late Precambrian, accreted as a composite terrane to North America during the early-middle Paleozoic, and were subsequently dispersed variable distances relative to each other. Identification of the constituent terrane elements within the composite terrane has been controversial, their tectonothermal evolution is uncertain, and the nature and timing of amalgamation, accretion and dispersal are poorly constrained. This project will address these issue through a comprehensive structural and 40Ar/39Ar geochronological study of a representative portion of the Avalon composite terrane in southwestern New Brunswick where recent studies have shown an important late Precambrain terrane boundary may exist. Results of a reconnaissance 40Ar//39Ar isotopic survey indicate that a significant contribution can be made in the proposed study area. The project couples detailed structural mapping kinematic analysis and petrological studies with a program of 40Ar/39Ar mineral dating designed to resolve the region's tectonothermal evolution. The study will substantially improve knowledge of the nature, timing and kinematics of tectonothermal events recorded in the Avalon composite terrane and, thereby, will greatly facilitate the identification and correlation of constituent late Precambrian terranes.\n",
      "a9003703 EAR $118000 Proposed research in the Devonian of the western U.S. involves five areas of endeavor. 1. Brachiopod systematics: one new brachiopod genus will be described and illustrated. In addition, the section on Silurian and Devonian spirifers will be prepared for the revised Brachiopod Treatise. Precise range data will be collated for Devonian brachiopod general. 2. The Middle and Upper Devonian faunal sequence will be studied and refined by synthesis of five measured sections and 229 fossil samples. Zonal refinement is anticipated near the top of the Middle Devonian. 3. The depositional history of an interval of the Late Devonian spanning the Frasnian-Famennian boundary will be studied in central Nevada. Quartz sands were deposited in the outer shelf basin at that time as a result of platform emergence. 4. It is intended to analyze geology in two critical areas along the frontal margin of the Roberts Mountains thrust from data gathered during the last 14 years. 5. A review paper is planned for preparation on the Paleozoic of the western U.S.\n",
      "a9003711 MCB $413102 As a model to study how plants react to pathogenic attack the response of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) to tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) is being investigated. In response to a variety of pathogenic and chemcial agents tobacco plants produce large amounts of pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins whose synthesis has been associated with resistance to TMV. This laboratory has focused on the synthesis, location, and function of the PR1 family of these proteins. Salicylic acid (SA) has been used extensively as an inducer of PR proteins and local acquired resistance to TMV. These observations together with the recent finding that endogenous SA levels rose at least 20-fold in leaves of TMV-resistant, but not susceptible, tobacco after TMV inoculation suggest that SA may be part of the natural induction pathway following TMV infection. A major objective is to determine the role of SA in induction of PR1 genes. This may provide an important avenue to define intermediate steps in the signal transduction pathway that leads to the defense response following pathogenic assault. As part of this analysis the cis acting element(s) and trans acting factor(s) necessary for SA induction will be defined. Many plants respond to viral infection by the production of certain proteins which have been termed \"pathogenesis-related proteins\". The goal of this research is to understand the molecular signals by which the genes for pathogenesis-related protein are activated. The results of this research will contribute to basic knowledge of the mechanisms of plant defense against viruses.\n",
      "a9003712 EAR $76880 A detailed petrogenetic study of two major intrusive complexes within the Bays-of-Maine igneous complex: the Pleasant bay layered gabbro and the Mt Desert Island igneous complex of gabbroic, dioritic and granitic rocks. In both areas layers of chilled to fine-grained gabbro and medium-grained diorite to granite occur intercalated with gabbroic cumulates. Although these unusual layers have in the past been interpreted as dikes or sills, field relations appear to be more consistent with their interpretation as conformable layers deposited on a magma chamber floor. Field, petrographic, and geochemical studies will be directed toward testing that thesis.\n",
      "a9003734 CTS $151500 In previous research it was established that non-living algal biomass immobilized in polymer beads effectively absorbs or binds a number of toxic metal ions from polluted process effluents. It is proposed to continue this investigation by: 1) continuing, the screening of algal genera or species for metal ion removal and recovery potential; 2) secondarily, extending the screening for metal ion binding to other cells, particularly, higher plant cells; and 3) extending primary efforts to identify the specific functional groups on the algal cell walls that permit metal ion binding. New investigation results will provide valuable insight into the application of algal polymers to the removal and the recovery of particular toxic, precious, and strategic metal ions from polluted-, geothermal-, and mining-water, and from industrial process streams.\n",

      "a9003737 MCB $252000 A detailed study of the enzymes, deoxycytidylate (dCMP) (dCD) and thymidylate (dTMP) synthase (TS), will be conducted in order to further understand how the structures of these two enzymes determine their catalytic specificities. Both enzymes are important in providing pyrimidine nucleotide precursors of DNA and are notably elevated in mitotically active tissues and cells. The availability of large quantities of T4 dCMP deaminase will make possible detailed studies on locating the substrate binding sites as well as the allosteric sites for dCTP and dTTP. Site- specific and random mutagenesis studies are planned to modify amino acids at the above binding sites to determine their influence on enzyme activity. dCMP deaminase is present in very low amounts in eucaryotic cells, but has been isolated and purified to homogeneity by using a modified substrate affinity column. Our ultimate goal is to use recombinant DNA methods to synthesize large amounts of the human dCMP deaminase in bacteria or yeast for further mechanistic and binding sites studies similar to those described in this proposal for T4 dCMP deaminase. Attempts will be made to crystallize T4-dCMP deaminase, as has been described by us for T2-dCMP deaminase, for x-ray structural studies in collaboration with colleagues at the Medical Foundation of Buffalo, Inc. Studies of T4-thymidylate synthase will center around the additional proteins expressed by the complete gene, which is composed of two exons separated by an intron. The significance of the Td gene encoded IRF protein, which possesses a specific endonuclease activity, will be studied with respect to its properties, its solubilization, processing and potential transposase activity. In addition the high level expression of the exon I and exon II genes of Td will be attempted. Continued emphasis will be placed on x-ray crystallographic comparisons of TS from different sources, of particular interest will be the structure of the phi3T phage TS.\n",
      "a9003739 IBN $179000 Determination is a developmental event which programs the future fate of a cell or a group of cells. It is often a stable state but not necessarily an irreversible condition. In general terms, a cell or group of cells is determined when it exhibits the same developmental fate whether grown in situ, in isolation, or at a new place in or on the organism. Determination has been extensively documented and studied, primarily in animals. In plant development, determination is often an obscure component because many plant cells are totipotent. Nevertheless, Dr. McDaniel has identified a situation in plant development, flowering in both day neutral and photoperiodic plants, in which determination is stable enough to permit investigation. The proposed study will continue his characterization of floral determination in the genus Nicotiana and extend his approach to the single cycle, long day plant, Lolium temulentum. Four topics will be addressed: 1) Employing clonal analysis, establish the developmental fate of cells in the meristem of florally determined terminal and axillary buds of day neutral tobacco, 2) Via tissue culture, establish the stability of the capacity of pedicle tissues to produce floral shoots, 3) Using reciprocal grafts, establish if the number of nodes produced by a N. tabacum cv. Wisconsin 38 shoot (scion) can be influenced by the roots (stock) of other cultivars of N. tabacum, 4) Using meristem/apex culture, establish the time for floral evocation, the time of floral determination, and characterize the influence of various gibberellic acids on the flowering process in Lolium temulentum. %%% Understanding determination is critical for any in depth, comprehensive understanding of development in multicellular organisms. This has proved a very difficult problem to attack in plant systems. The determination of a plant to flower has been developed into an approachable system for this study.\n",

Most of these problems bear on the problem, \"How much control is enough to force simple homotopy equivalence between polyhedra or homeomorphism between topological manifolds?\" An interesting testing ground for controlled theories is on the borderline between topology and differential geometry, where there are problems which are obviously controlled in some way but for which there is no obvious control space. Ferry has already solved one such problem by, in some sense, letting the problem construct its own control space. He plans to explore further ramifications of these techniques.\n",
      "a9003748 EAR $130400 The high-pressure stability of majority garnet will be experimentally determined at 165-230 kbar pressures, 1650and higher temperatures, with the split-sphere anvil apparatus in Stony Brook (USSA-2000). The study would include: 1. The determination of the equilibrium compositions of enstatite- jadeite garnet coexisting with MgSiO3 ilmenite, and NaAlSiO4 (calcium ferrite structure) + stishovite; 2. The determination of the compositions of diopside-jadeite garnet coexisting with pyroxene, CaSiO3 perovskite, and NaAlSiO4 + stishovite. The compositions of enstatite-pyrope garnet coexisting with MgSiO3- Al2O3 perovskite would be determined at 220-280 kbar, 2000oC, If new developments are successful in reaching those pressures. The results of the proposed experiments would place new constraints on the nature of the 650 km discontinuity, and on the cause of the high-velocity gradients in the vicinity of the 650 km discontinuity. The results would also allow to evaluate the effect of sodium on the CMAS phase relations, which would lead to a better understanding of the Earth Mantle mineralogy. Supplementary projects could include: 1. The determination of the melting curves of simple compounds at 165-230 kbar, e.g. Mg4Si4O12 garnet, beta phase, diopside, CaSiO3 perovskite, grossular, jadeite; 2.

      "a9003750 MCB $100000 Yeast provides an excellent system for the study of Golgi secretory function because of its tractability to genetic, molecular, biochemical, and cell biological analyses. This project focuses on the role of SEC14p, the protein gene product of the SEC14 gene identified previously as being required for normal yeast secretory activity. Prior work under NSF support has shown that SEC14p is a cytosolic protein, which somehow is required for export of proteins from the lumen of the Golgi. Also, extragenic suppressors of sec14-ts have been characterized. The long-term goal of the project is to understand, at the molecular level, how the secretory process functions. The specific aim of the proposed research is to identify and characterize the specific membrane compartment of the Golgi apparatus which is involved in the function of SEC14p. This study will involve enrichment of the compartment from temperature-sensitive sec14 mutants by biochemical means, and immuno-identification of these compartments using antibodies against various gene products known (from genetic analyses) to be involved in SEC14p function. The function of the Golgi in the secretory process is an important question relevant to several disciplines of the life sciences. These studies will make an important contribution to this area of research.\n",

External pH is a major environmental parameter for bacteria, and internal pH is significant in terms of bacterial physiology and energy transduction. Two novel pH- regulated loci, isolated as lacZ operon fusions, will be studied: ina inducible by membrane-permeable weak acids and protonophores, and alx inducible by external base. These loci will be cloned and sequenced, and their sequences analyzed for promoters and regulatory sites. The possible regulatory role of acid-sensitive sequences such as H-DNA will be investigated. The pH dependence of ina transcription will be tested in vitro. Regulator genes for ina and alx will be isolated, by screening Tn10 pools for isolates which are either constitutive or uninducible.

Field studies will be completed, ages will be determined, and petrographic, electron probe, major and trace element, and isotopic analyses will be made. Major and trace element and Nd and Sr isotope abundances will be compared with those of rocks in contrasting tectonic settings to test theories for magma genesis, for metasomatism of continental lithosphere, and for relationships between melt generation and subduction. Pyroxene textures resemble those ascribed to magma mixing, and isotopic as well as chemical studies will be used to investigate the importance of the process in producing the diverse rock types at Two Buttes and elsewhere.\n",

The thrust of this project is to study the earthquake effect on masonry and masonry veneer buildings based on analysis and damage observations. The overall objective of this project is to improve the seismic safety of masonry and masonry veneer buildings in the United States. Its specific objective is to evaluate the seismic performance of masonry and masonry veneer buildings in the October 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, with particular attention to the behavior of selected buildings. The following task will be undertaken: l) review the overall behavior of masonry and masonry veneer buildings; 2) select a small number (3-5) of such buildings for further study, based on their usefulness as prototypes, and on the availability of strong-motion records, 3) study their damages in detail, and compare their responses with that predicted analytically; and 4) using this comparison, assess the effectiveness of existing masonry design codes, estimate the probable hazard of existing masonry buildings, and provide useful information to those concerned with the repair and retrofit of masonry buildings. This study will lead to an improved understanding of the seismic damage to masonry and masonry veneer buildings and the development of practical ways to mitigate such future damage to such existing buildings in seismic hazard areas.\n",

      "a9003785 CMS $45384 This project addresses the lessons learned from the 17 October 1989 Northern California (Loma Prieta) earthquake. Local soil/geologic conditions can modify incoming earthquake strong-motions wave trains, causing them to be more damaging. It is well accepted that this effect occurred during the Loma Prieta earthquake. Much can be learned about site-specific seismic response using the wealth of strong-motion data recorded during this earthquake. But in order to understand the observed seismic response, a necessary first step is to define the area's stratigraphy as precisely as possible. This is the objective of this research program. This project seeks to obtain and to analyze all available data on the stratigraphy of the Pleistocene fill, the depth to the basement rock, and to tabulate all measured physical properties of the Pleistocene units for correlation with expectable ranges in velocity propagation. The aim is to prepare precise stratigraphic fence diagrams, unit isopach maps, and to tabulate physical properties and downhole testing data for each geologic unit penetrated. These data form a first step for other studies, such as in defining the seismic response for the Oakland-Alameda Bay Bridge area.\n",

This project is directed toward the evaluation of the performance, including interpretation and analysis of earthquake-response records, of the well-instrumented six earth dams which were shaken by the Loma Prieta, California earthquake (M=7.1) of October 17, 1989. The shaking during the main and after shocks triggered most of the accelerographs on the six dams (one of them is partially damaged) providing the most extensive array of earthquake response measurements yet obtained in the U.S. and abroad. The data obtained will be used to (1) study the effects of sequential earthquakes on the safety of earth dams, (2) correlate dynamic properties (shear modulus and damping) extracted from field performance during earthquakes, via system identification techniques, with existing laboratory-measured properties of the dam materials, (3) verify the adequacy of existing procedures for seismic analysis of earth dams by applying them to observational data and by comparing predicted results with measured responses, (4) disseminate research findings, and (5) document and improve capability to assess the safety of earth dams. The study will provide a comprehensive knowledge base for evaluation of seismic safety of earth dams.\n",

Detailed illustrations will be presented of acts of female aggression and victimization and their sociocultural context. It will also integrate the Aboriginal data with those of other studies in order to address a number of current issues about female aggression including gender/sex differences in aggression, female competition, and women's roles in family violence. Finally, it will analyze the impact of Western theories and stereotyped on the study of female aggression and victimization and suggest appropriate modifications of current theory. Interactive activities will include teaching a graduate seminar on women and aggression as well as a team.taught undergraduate course on Australian Aboriginal Ethnography. This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering by providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.

      "a9003817 IBN $215000 The synthesis of phosphatidylcholine in plants has been thought to occur primarily through phosphorylation of choline, followed by conversion to CDPcholine, and then transfer of a phosphatidate group to the choline to give the final lipid product. An alternate pathway has been proposed which involves three sequential methylations, utilizing S- adenosyl-L-methionine, of the amino group of phosphatidylethanolamine. Recent research has indicated that in some tissues, such as castor bean endosperm, the choline produced from a commonly assumed precursor, L-serine, may not be available for phosphatidylcholine synthesis. In addition, evidence now is available that in several tissues phosphatidylethanolamine does not act as a substrate for methylation, unlike the case in yeast and mammalian tissues. Thus, either plants differ in some respects from yeast and mammalian systems in the exact pathways of methylation and their regulation, or some aspects of the methylation scheme have not been detected and examined in these other systems. The goals of this proposal are to examine these newly described initial methylation enzymes in detail, to try to determine a source of choline for the nucleotide (CDP- derivative) pathway (and for regulation of the functioning of the methylation pathway), and to continue our investigations into the enzymes of the nucleotide pathway. We will characterize the methylation enzymes, work on their purifications, and test for regulation through allosteric and/or membrane-enzyme interactions as well as phosphorylation/dephosphorylation. Various plant organs, particularly leaves and roots, will be tested for a capacity to synthesize and export choline or choline-P. Phospholipids are important components of membranes of all living organisms. They play crucial structural and metabolic role; yet their pathways of synthesis are incompletely known, especially in plants. This project affords the opportunity to elucidate important pathways of phospholipid synthesis and regulation in a model plant system.***//\n",
      "a9003818 MCB $270000 The major long-term objectives of the research of this laboratory are to define the chromosome of Staphylococcus aureus, and thus gain a better understanding of the factors that are responsible for pathogenicity, the manner by which extrachromosomal elements contribute to it's characteristics, and to evaluate the degree of diversity that exists within the genus Staphylococcus. The specific aims of this proposed research are to (1) continue with the characterization of the chromosome map of NCTC 8325 (phage group III) S. aureus, (2) continue to characterize the chromosome maps of strains 112 (phage group I) and Ps55 (phage group II), and their relationship to the NCTC 8325 map, (3) develop and evaluate potentially useful mutations that should expand the spectrum of useful approaches and flexibility of genetic analysis in S. aureus, (4) analyze the S. aureus chromosome for the presence of tandem genetic duplications from the perspective of using them as an aid in chromosome mapping, and (5) initiate the development of the necessary mapping techniques to develop genetic/physical chromosome maps of representative coagulase-negative staphylococci.//\n",
      "a9003822 DMS $48050 This award is for support of the research in arithmetic algebraic geometry of Dr. Noam Elkies of Harvard University. Dr. Elkies proposes to continue his studies of the arithmetic of supersingular curves over function fields with finite constant field; by looking closely at these, he has already discovered sphere packings in certain high-dimensional Euclidean spaces that are more dense than any previously known. In addition, Dr. Elkies plans to investigate explicit modular equations from a computational viewpoint and connect these with the abstract theory of heights. This is research in the field of arithmetic algebraic geometry, a subject that combines the techniques of algebraic geometry and number theory. In its original formulation, algebraic geometry treated figures that could be defined in the plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Number theory started with the whole numbers and such questions as divisibility of one whole number by another. These two subjects, seemingly so far apart, have in fact influenced each other from the earliest times, but in the past quarter century the mutual influence has increased greatly. The field of arithmetic algebraic geometry now uses techniques from all of modern mathematics, and is having corresponding influence beyond its own borders.\n",
      "a9003829 AST $49700 The nuclei of many galaxies show evidence of mild activity, such as very broad (but weak) emission due to hydrogen. These are generally thought to be scaled-down versions of luminous active galactic nuclei (AGNs), in which matter is probably being accret- ed by a massive black hole. During the past few years, however, a few investigators have speculated that the properties of low- luminosity AGNs might instead be explained by processes related to central bursts of star formation. Although this is not a popular idea, recent evidence from observations of supernovae lend some support to this idea. This research will explore this model from both theoretical and observational approaches. Dr. Filippenko is an extremely active young astronomer, who has most recently been much concerned with the design and utilization of automated observatories in the study of active galactic nuclei and extragalactic supernovae. He currently holds a Presidential Young Investigator award.\n",
      "a9003834 DMS $20000 Isbell will continue his study of a reinterpretation of descriptive set theory, the natural interpretation in metrizable locales. This shift has already been shown to produce at least one gain in metrizable spaces (the standard setting) although there are three or four losses. The completed work is almost all in Borel multiplicative class 1. Most of the main problems now visible are in multiplicative class 2 (F-sigma-delta). Hopeful indications that the technical losses by the central reinterpretation may be outweighed by conceptual enrichment are to be explored. The goal is to shed light on standard descriptive set theory by demonstrating the existence of an alternative.\n",

His investigation will include work on generalizations of the Bishop-Stone-Weierstrass theorem for subalgebras of a C* or W* algebra, a study of the notion of reflexivity for operators and operator algebras, and of invariant operator ranges, among other topics. Hilbert space operators are essentially infinite matrices of complex numbers. These operators have applications in every area of applied science as well as in pure mathematics. This type of research is an attempt to classify certain important categories of such objects.\n",
      "a9003839 ATM $377035 The existence of the rapid, Younger Dryas climate event in the southern hemisphere is still a matter of great debate. If this event had detectable effects in the southern hemisphere, then variations in climate caused by internal oscillations may be important for altering climate on a global scale. This proposal requests support to reconstruct the high frequency changes in climate observed in the southern hemisphere during the last glacial-interglacial transition, the time of the Younger Dryas event. The paleoclimate records will be based on pollen assemblage variations and D/H ratios in peat sections. D/H ratios are a function of temperature and moisture availability. The PIs wish to calibrate the D/H variations for this region and then use the calibration to quantify the variations in the past. Thus the D/H ratios will supplement the pollen data and help to identify what climate parameters changed during the deglaciation. This research is important because we do not yet know the history of climate in the southern hemisphere. It is necessary to understand the extent of climate change in this hemisphere before we fully understand the mechanisms of abrupt climate change.\n",
      "a9003841 IIS $125181 This project aims to develop a formal and implementable theory of the communicative interactions that can occur within a man- machine dialog. It will develop a plan-based model of the interaction - explicity representing the differing beliefs of the system and the user, as well as their mutually shared beliefs arising from the dialog, and representing the sentences in the dialog explicitly as actions - both as speech acts reflecting immediate intentions, and as discourse acts, signalling the structure of the dialog. The goal is to develop a domain- independent model of dialog interaction, focusing on those aspects that allow the system and user to monitor how well the dialog is understood. In particular, the intent is to account for the prevalent acknowledgement behavior in dialog, and to provide a general account of clarifications and correction subdialogs. The work also will examine how the planning model affects the actual interpretation of the sentences in the dialog, concentrating on the effects the model has on speech act interpretation, and the interpretation of tense and aspect, and the generic/specific distinction. As a result, the plan-based approach to language will be brought into much closer correspondence to the actual linguistic behavior apparent in natural dialogs.\n",

The source of the new data is the Indian white-light solar plates began in 1905 in the Kodaikanal Observatory, which is of excellent quality. The combination of the Kodaikanal and Mount Wilson data could make the finest sunspot data set in existence. It will provide many times the number of sunspots now available for statistical studies of rotation and latitude drift and spot areas. This will increase the precision of the averaged results for the cycle-related rotation rate changes found in the data set. It will also increase the confidence in small-amplitude effects which is low given the the limits of the U.S. data set, as well as increase the potential for detecting low-amplitude effects. These measured drifts have an important bearing on the large-scale dynamics of the solar convection zone and is believed to be responsible for the 11-year activity cycle. Scope: The U.S. P.I.

      "a9003850 OPP $1 This project will provide logistical support for the launch of a long duration balloon for the study of the isotopic composition of heavy (iron group) cosmic rays. The project is called MAGPIE: Magnetic Passive Isotope Experiment, and consists of special plastic sheets that can be etched to reveal tracks made by energetic cosmic rays. The plastic is mounted in a strong magnetic field that is produced by a superconducting magnet. The experiment will determine the isotopic composition with unprecedented accuracy, and will thereby provide information on the elemental makeup of the galaxy and the stellar processes which produce all of the heavier elements. Due to the high geomagnetic latitude of Antarctica these fairly low energy heavy ions will reach the atmosphere in much larger numbers than they would at mid-latitudes. This, combined with the lack of diurnal heating and cooling of the balloon, because of the constant sunshine during the polar summer, makes long duration ballooning in Antarctica for cosmic ray research very attractive. The funds for the researchers and the launch of the balloon will be provided by NASA. NSF will provide logistical support and the recovery of the payload.//\n",

Faris' major goal is to describe the role of scattering resonances in determining the scattering properties of a random obstacle. Another goal is to understand random wave diffusion. The study of random media is of great interest in modern physics and mathematics. The idea here is that in certain types of materials the atoms are not arranged in a regular manner. In fact the materials tend to look rather chaotic. The mathematical model then is probabilistic, and one tries to find statements which are true with probability one.\n",

      "a9003868 SES $12700 Within recent years the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe have undergone major changes at a dramatic pace. While it might be expected that political values in a culture influence processes of change, there is little systematic knowledge about the legal and political culture of the Soviet Union. This research constitutes a unique and important opportunity to advance our understanding of how beliefs, values, and attitudes of ordinary citizens structure both the pace and the possibility of change. The core of the study is a survey of public opinion in greater Moscow. It is anticipated that approximately 500 respondents will be interviewed face-to-face in hour long sessions. While the research team is an interdisciplinary group of U.S. scholars, the data collection itself will be performed under the direction of the Institute of Sociology, National Academy of Sciences. This research anticipates several contributions. First, it should enable developing a profile of the major attributes of Soviet legal and political culture. Second, it should permit testing a variety of hypotheses about the origins of Soviet values. Third, these survey data should lend themselves to exploratory analyses of the differences in value content and structure between the Soviet Union, Western Europe, and the United States. Finally, the survey will be extremely useful in establishing baseline data for studying processes of political change in the future.\n",

TIMR technique was initially developed by Dr. Prieve. It measures the interaction potential between a particle and a wall. Interaction forces as small as a few picograms have been experimentally determined with this technique. In this project, TIMR will be applied to study the dynamics of hindered Brownian motion of a sphere and diffusion coefficients near a wall. The results can be related to the rates of flocculation and deposition of particles from moving fluids.\n",
      "a9003883 ECS $29896 Declamination is one of the most common failure modes of composite materials. It occurrence may be due to either imperfections in the production process or the effect of external factors during the operational life of the composite laminates, e.g. impact by foreign objects. The presence of declamination can reduce the buckling load of the composite leading to global structural failure at loads below the design level. This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) deals with the development of two computational approaches to solve the moving boundary problem, i.e. the dynamics of the growth of a thin strip declamination in a thick based laminate. The governing equation is a nonlinear integro-differential equation where the unknown length of delaminated strip appears not only in the boundary- condition but also in the equation of motion.\n",

      "a9003888 CMS $44730 This is a post Loma Prieta earthquake (Oct. 1989) investigation project in learning from this damaging event. The objectives of the research are to use these records to: (1) conduct a comprehensive building performance study for the time-varying nature of vibration periods and damping, and (2) estimate the maximum story drift, a crucial quantity for the assessment of possible building damage. A well established system identification method, improved in accuracy and efficiency in a related research program supported by the National Science Foundation, will be used for the parameter identification in this research. The identification of the vibration period and damping will be carried out for about 40 building records. The story drift estimation requires the development of a new method and will be carried out for selected buildings. The time-varying nature of the building period, damping, and story drift will be used to assess and calibrate the building damage state. The information obtained will form the basis for a building performance evaluation procedure. Based on the findings of this research, a procedure of post-earthquake building performance evaluation using strong motion records will be recommended for future applications.\n",
      "a9003890 CMS $68414 This is a post Loma Prieta earthquake (Oct. 1989) investigation project in learning from this damaging event. The ATC-20 \"Procedures for Postearthquake Safety Evaluation of Buildings,\" published by Applied Technology Council (ATC) on September 19, 1989, were used extensively throughout Northern California to evaluate buildings damaged by the magnitude-7.1 October 17, 1989 Loma Prieta, California, earthquake. The widespread application of the methodology on several thousand buildings by building officials and volunteer structural engineers from throughout the state has provided a rare and ideal opportunity to assess the merits and possible pitfalls of the methodology. Based upon such an experience, this project will conduct a study to review, evaluate, and possibly revise the ATC- 20. The specific objectives are to: (1) document the application of the ATC-20 methodology; (2) conduct a workshop to review, expand, and evaluate this documentation and develop recommendations for improved procedures; (3) develop and publish an addendum to the ATC-20 Report containing a summary of the Loma Prieta earthquake experience, a summary of the project workshop findings, additional instructions and clarifications for \"difficult to determine\" posting situations, and a recommended management program for local building officials; (4) revise and re-publish, if necessary, the ATC-20 Report and ATC-20-1 Field Manual; and (5) conduct training seminars that include an overview of the Loma Prieta experience.

      "a9003898 DEB $34796 The goal of this fellowship will be to advance knowledge of the ecological role of Neotropical Chrysomelidae through field studies concentrating on identifying hostplants and on larval studies. This research will be performed in Guanacaste National Park, Costa Rica, because it has a rich and easily accessible fauna and because Costa Rica is an international center for the study of tropical biodiversity. The research will be done in cooperation with local scientists at the Costa rican National Institute of Biodiversity and made available through the Institute to the international scientific community and to Costa Rican institutions. The Chrysomelidae are the second largest family of beetles and are particularly diverse in the American tropics. Almost all are plant feeders and many are crop pests. Their role in wild tropical ecosystems is largely unstudied and hostplant and life history information is available for only a small minority of Neotropical species. By concentrating field work at Guanacaste National Park, the PI will be able to take advantage of a large body of accumulated botanical and ecological knowledge of the Park; at the same time,the diversity of habitats in the park will make findings from this project relevant to many other areas of Central America.\n",
      "a9003907 DMS $129950 This award supports the research in the analytic number theory of automorphic and modular forms of Professor Dorian Goldfeld of Columbia University. Dr. Goldfeld plans to investigate the growth of the coefficients of meromorphic modular functions and hopes to derive asymptotic formulas for these in terms of Kloosterman sums. A related project of Professor Goldfeld is to relate the arithmetic of a modular elliptic curve to the minimal hyperbolic distance between the zeros of the Hecke cusp form of weight two associated to this curve. Non-Euclidean plane geometry began in the early nineteenth century as a mathematical curiosity, but by the end of that century, mathematicians had realized that many objects of fundamental importance are non-Euclidean in their basic nature. The detailed study of non-Euclidean plane geometries has given rise to several branches of modern mathematics, of which the study of modular and automorphic forms is one of the most active. This field is principally concerned with questions about the whole numbers, but in its use of geometry and analysis, it retains connection to its historical roots.\n",
      "a9003908 IBN $240000 The long term objectives of this project are to understand how genes interact to specify the body plan during development. Several tissue specific mammalian positive transcriptional activators share an approximately 150 amino acid region, the POU domain. This proposal focuses on three newly isolated POU domain genes from Drosophila: what are their structures, what are the natures of their protein products, when and where in development are they expressed, and what are the effects of perturbing their normal expression. The DNA sequences of cDNA clones originating from each of the genes will show the expected structure of the protein products and will allow their comparison with the mammalian POU domain genes. Determination of the expression patterns of each gene by in situ hybridization and by immunohistochemical staining with antibodies will help indicate what their roles in regulating development may be. Fly strains containing each of the three genes under heat inducible control will be made. The effects of disrupting the normal expression of the genes will also show the roles each may play in development. %%% A central question in developmental biology is how genes act to produce a complex structure. This project is to investigate that question by examining the regulation of genes involved in early patterning events in the Drosophila embryo.\n",
      "a9003912 IBN $240000 Regulatory information is passed from one cell or tissue type to another during the development of multicellular organisms. Development of the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, has been described in detail at the cellular level and includes several instances where regulatory cell-cell interactions decide cell fate. This proposal investigates the mechanisms underlying two such regulatory interactions: induction of mitosis in the germ line and induction of pharyngeal muscle cells in the early embryo. These two events occur at different times and in different tissues but share a common component: the glp-1 gene. Extensive genetic and molecular studies suggest that glp-1 acts as a signal receptor in each of the induced tissues. Dr. Maine has generated extragenic suppressors of glp-1 mutations as a way of identifying genes responsible for signal production in the inducing tissue and signal transduction in the induced tissue. This proposal outlines genetic and molecular studies and cell ablation experiments that are designed to analyze the role(s) of these newly identified genes in the germ line and embryonic cell- cell interactions. In particular, the proposal focuses on one gene identified as a recessive suppressors, sog-1, and on a set of dominant suppressors that are linked to glp-1. %%% The proposed studies are designed to investigate how cell fate is specified during the development of multicellular organisms. In particular, the experiments will focus on the cell-cell interactions that are reguired to specify the fates of individual cells as they differentiate into one or another adult cell type.\n",
      "a9003915 EAR $135000 Trace and minor element distributions have played a major role in interpreting carbonate mineral formation and diagenesis in sedimentary environments. Sorption and coprecipitation processes involving carbonates also figure importantly in controlling trace metal concentrations in near-surface waters. However, major limitations in efforts to model such processes quantitatively result from a poor understanding of factors that influence partitioning of elements between aqueous solutions and carbonate minerals, especially the abundant mineral calcite. Findings that surface crystal structure, and particularly the geometry and structure of growth steps, exert strong influences on selective element incorporation, offer a means by which to examine the very surface mechanisms that cause such selectivity in partitioning. By correlating surface structural features imaged by differential interference contrast microscopy with quantitative trends of selective enrichment for various elements over a range of conditions, the relative influences of growth rate and surface structure on element partitioning will be evaluated. The present research project will provide insight to the most fundamental mechanisms operating during crystal growth, specifically those factors that influence trace and minor element distribution. In addition, this research will lead to a capability of predicting differential partitioning trends that are element specific and their associated crystal growth rate effects.\n",
      "a9003917 IBN $200000 Unicellular algae, including Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, have the capacity to concentrate CO2 internally, allowing these organisms to grow photoautotrophically at CO2 concentrations lower than most higher plants can tolerate. This CO2 concentrating mechanism is inducible; it is present only in cells that have been grown with limiting CO2 conditions. An important aspect of this Ci (Ci = CO2 + HCO3- + CO3-2) accumulation system is located in the chloroplast. Intact chloroplasts isolated from low CO2- grown C. reinhardtii cells retain the ability to accumulate Ci to much higher levels than intact chloroplasts isolated from high Co2-grown cells. Five polypeptides that are specifically induced by growth on low CO2 and are missing in the high CO2-requiring strain CIA-5 have been identified. One of these proteins is a carbonic anhydrase located in the periplasmic space and another is a 36 kDa membrane associated polypeptide located in intact chloroplasts. The other three proteins are soluble and their function is unknown. The role of the chloroplast in Ci accumulation is being characterized by determining Ci uptake in intact chloroplasts from wild-type and high CO2-requiring C. reinhardtii strains. The role of the 36 kDa polypeptide in this uptake process is also being investigated. This protein is located on the chloroplast, possibly in the chloroplast envelope, and may be responsible, in part, for the increase in Ci uptake observed in chloroplasts from low CO2-grown cultures. The chloroplast carbonic anhydrase a low abundance, constitutively made protein that is required for efficient CO2 fixation is also being studied. The role of the three other low CO2-induced polypeptides is unknown. A cDNA library is being made to mRNA isolated from low CO2-grown cells and differentially screened with cDNA made from mRNA from low and high CO2-grown cells. This will identify many of the low CO2-inducible genes required for growth on low CO2. The eventual characterization of the proteins of this transport system will increase our understanding of the low CO2 adjustment in algae and the role of the chloroplast in this photosynthetic adaptation. Photosynthesis involves the photoassimilation of carbon dioxide (CO2) and the photoevolution of oxygen (O2). Partly due to this gas exchange activity of plants, earth's atmosphere changed in composition from one that was high in CO2 and low in O2 to one that is high in O2 and low in CO2. Under current conditions, the rate of CO2 fixation and thus plant growth, can be limited by CO2. Many unicellular algae can adapt to low CO2 conditions so that they become very efficient in their utiliation of CO2 for photosynthesis. This adaptation results from an enhancement of the cells' ability to transport and accumulate inorganic carbon. These studies characterize the protein components required for the efficient use of CO2 in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Emphasis is placed on the role of the chloroplast in inorganic carbon acquisition.\n",

These adjustments apparently help optimize photosynthesis and allow the plant to retain efficient growth under suboptimal and/or adverse irradiance conditions. The overall goal of this research is to understand the fundamental mechanism of plant response to suboptimal and adverse irradiance. Components of thylakoid membranes which are found in chloroplasts will be studied. Specific goals of this proposal are to identify the primary receptor of the signal (irradiance stress) and elucidate the first step in the signal transduction and transformation process leading to a plant response. Experimental methodologies and approaches to be employed include absorbance difference spectrophotometry, gel electrophoresis and immunoblot (western) analysis, radioactive labelling and autoradiography, and DNA-RNA hybridization (northern analysis). This research addresses a novel idea, namely that photosynthetic pigments act in the primary step of adverse irradiance recognition and that signal transduction is mediated by electron transport reactions in the thylakoid membrane. There is preliminary evidence to suggest that such a molecular feedback control mechanism guides plant response to irradiance stress and this proposal will examine this mechanism. Results from this research will improve our understanding of the mechanisms by which photosynthetic plants perceive and adapt to irradiance stress including ultraviolet radiation (UV-B). This will have implications for predicting plant response to potential increases in UV-B that may result from depletion of stratospheric ozone in the atmosphere.\n",
      "a9003930 EAR $93500 The information derived from this investigation will be applicable to such diverse problems as the origin of island arc volcanic series and the trace element characteristics of the mantle as well as being applicable to the understanding of the formation and evolution of the majority of volcanic rocks on earth. In addition, this data will be used to calculate mineral- liquid expressions to improve our existing model for the simulation of igneous differentiation. To understand the evolution of natural volcanic magmas, we must understand the chemical relationship between the magmatic liquid and the minerals that crystallize from it. At present, there is not enough data to define this chemical relationship for major and trace elements for several important minerals in basalt magmas. The focus of our proposed two-year project is to determine experimentally the mineral-liquid relationship for magnetite and ilmenite in natural silicate liquids that range in composition from basalt to dacite. Our knowledge of trace element behavior in magmas that crystallize magnetite and ilmenite is largely restricted to a few experiments and to measurements on mechanically separated oxides. The published results of these studies can vary by a factor of 100 for a given element. Our two objectives are to define magnetite and ilmenite-liquid phase equilibria, and to determine the geochemical behavior of several trace elements between magnetite, ilmenite and magmatic liquid. The trace elements to be studied include members of the first transition series (V, Ti, Ni, Sc) and the high field strength elements (Hf, Zr, Nb, Ta, Th, U). We will determine the major and trace element compositions of the magnetite and co-existing glass by electron microprobe. The concentration of the trace elements will be raised above the detection limits of the microprobe by adding pure oxides of those elements to the samples in the O.5-1.O% range. In addition, low concentration dopant (10-200 ppm) experiments will be conducted and analyzed by ion probe. Most experiments will be done at 1- atm. However, to test the effect of pressure, experiments will be conducted at 5, 10, 15, and 25 kb on three of the starting compositions. The range of oxide saturation and oxide composition will be extended by Ti and Fe addition, and by using a range of oxygen fugacities.\n",
      "a9003933 CHE $375000 This award is made in the Materials Chemistry and Chemical Processing Initiative in support of the collaborative research of Professors Strouse and Anet at the University of California at Los Angeles. Joint funding is provided by the Divisions of Chemistry and Materials Research. The thrust of the research is the synthesis, characterization and applications of programmable lattice clathrates prepared from metalloporphyrins. Crystalline metallotetraphenylporphyrin complexes represent a class of lattice clathrates in which the axial coordination sites of the porphyrin metal atoms are directed into hydrophobic channels. This feature provides a simple means for programming the clathrate lattice which will be the basis for a new strategy for molecular recognition, to exercise control over the metal atom environment, or to manipulate the structure of the porphyrin lattice. Applications will be sought which will take advantage of the rich chemistry of metalloporphyrins, the accessibility and selectivity provided by the channel structure, and the rigidity of the clathrate lattice. Materials characterization and synthetic modification studies will be directed toward applications which range from chemical separations to energy conversion. Parallel chemical studies and computational analyses will be designed to provide a more fundamental understanding of the dynamics and energetics of clathrate binding. The database afforded by the combined investigations will allow efficient exploitation of these materials in a broad range of scientific and technological applications.\n",
      "a9003935 EAR $28018 In the eastern portion of the Western Gneiss region of the central Norwegian Caledonides a sequence of cover and structurally higher units have been intricately infolded with basement gneisses. The regional interference patterns have previously been explained as the combined result of gneiss dome and basin formation, recumbent folding and late cross-folding. Recent mapping however shows that the patterns can be reinterpreted as a refolded sequence of three highly noncylindrical recumbent nappes with a sheath-like form. This project will test the possibility that very large sheath folds, on the order of 30 kilometers in wavelength, occur in this orogen. Results are applicable to other deep-seated orogens where large crystalline thrust sheets have moved long distances.\n",
      "a9003937 MCB $195000 The relative roles of chloroplastic amylolytic enzymes in intiating leaf starch degradation and metabolizing the immediate products of starch grain degradation are unknown. The roles of the extrachloroplastic amyloytic enzymes in photosynthetic tissues have yet to be elucidated. In species that have been examined, most of the amylolytic activity in photosynthetic tissues is extrachloroplastic, with B-amylase found primarily in the vacuole and a-amylase primarily in the apoplast. This research identifies the chloroplast amylolytic enzymes that can directly attack leaf starch granules, and those that cannot, and determines how these enzymes might act together to degrade leaf starch; (2) characterizes chloroplastic and extrachloroplastic a- glucosidase; and (3) verifies or disproves the localization of the primarily apoplastic a-amylase, the primarily vacuolar B-amylase, and a-glucosidases by immunohistochemistry. Starch, an end-product of higher plant photosynthesis, is stored in leaves, stems, roots and seeds as an energy reserve. During the night and other periods of reduced photosynthetic rates, starch degradation is the most important source of substrates for metabolic processes in leaves of many higher plants. Although leaf starch degradation is an important process in the regulation of plant metabolism and plant development, little is known about its regulation. Identification of the enzymes that actually attack leaf granules is a prerequisite to elucidating the mechanisms which regulate starch degradation and, therefore, carbon metabolism in plants.***//\n",

With advances in technology it is now possible to address real-time changes in the morphology of the earth that results from processes such as tectonism (mountain building, earthquakes activity) and the growth or decay of the earth's major ice sheets. Such studies will be most important in bringing Antarctica into the mainstream of global earth-science research. The workshop will: 1) identify and develop the scientific objectives for a coordinated campaign, 2) identify the technical needs associated with such a campaign and 3) draw up a plan for a possible campaign.\n",
      "a9003944 DMS $12687 Professor Trow will conduct research in the area of symbolic dynamics, a branch of dynamical systems. His research will be primarily concerned with factor maps between shifts of finite type. Factor maps are continuous, surjective, shift commuting maps. They are the sliding-block codes of information theory. Professor Trow is interested in the question of existence of these maps, and their possible degrees. These questions are closely related to topological conjugacy of shifts of finite type, the central problem of symbolic dynamics. The objects of study in symbolic dynamics are sets (called symbol spaces) whose elements are bi-infinite sequences of symbols, together with the shift map. These spaces are natural models for a large class of dynamical systems. They are of great interest to ergodic theorists and information and coding experts.\n",

      "a9003951 EAR $270745 This program involves experimental studies of the partitioning of siderophile and other elements between lithophile phases and silicate melts at pressures varying from 1 bar to in excess of 200 kbars and temperatures varying from 1300oC to in excess of 2300oC. Knowledge of these partition coefficients is essential to the interpretation of elemental systematics in the mantle and mantle- derived materials and specifically bears on the question of the early differentiation of the Earth. These experiments also bear directly on the thermodynamics and economic geology of the platinum group elements (PGE). During the next award period, the P.I.'s (i) continue ultrahigh pressure experiments between olivine/melt, majorite/melt, and Mg- perovskite/melt phase pairs, including ultrahigh pressure reversal experiments; (ii) continue the systematic study of noble melt solubilities in silicate melts and partitioning between coexisting phases as functions of intensive variables; and (iii) conduct experiments investigating the partitioning of Ga and Ge between garnet/melt and clinopyroxene/melt pairs. The results f the experiments will be applied to understanding the early thermal history and differentiation of the Earth and to the thermodynamics and economic geology of the PGE.\n",

      "a9003954 EAR $90000 It is widely recognized that fabrics preserved in natural tectonites record a portion of the strain history and the physical conditions surrounding the deformation. Full use of fabric data, however, is prevented by the uncertainty in the relationships that may exist between the fabric, the grain-scale deformation processes and the rock's mechanical behavior. This project will develop methods to add capability of making stress- strain measurements to previously developed techniques using low melting- point analog materials that are able to follow development of fabrics microscopically. The addition will facilitate application of synkinematic microscopy methods to problems of deep-earthquake source mechanisms, growth of minerals during deformation and an assessment of how much of the microstructure in natural tectonites represents the microstructure present during deformation.\n",

      "a9003961 BCS $7080 Under the direction of his advisors Drs. Kathleen Deagan and Elizabeth Wing, Mr. James Cusick will analyze material from the archaeological site of St. Augustine. The resulting data will provide the basis for his doctoral dissertation. St. Augustine, located in Florida, is one of the oldest European settlements in the New World. It was founded by the Spanish but also occupied by Minorcans as well as other ethnic groups. Because of its age and cultural complexity, the site has been extensively excavated. Its importance rests not only on the amount of archaeological material which has been recovered but also on the detailed archival records which contain information on individual families. Mr. Cusick will focus his attention on a sample of nine households of both Spanish and of Minorcan origin. Not only is archival information available for all but the living sites of each have been carefully excavated. Mr. Cusick will integrate the documentary evidence with information derived from analysis of material objects, floral, and faunal remains. He will examine how the economic and social strategies of these families changed over time and how these shifts are related to ethnic, economic, and status factors. The goal of this project is to examine the role which ethnicity plays in shaping household adaptation strategies. Minorcans were a minority group in St. Augustine, and with joint archaeological and archival data it will be possible to determine how such groups reacted, in comparison with the dominant Spanish majority, to changing economic and political conditions. One major theoretical question debated in the sociological literature concerns the extent to which response follows ethnic lines. Some argue it is more closely correlated with cross cutting economic distinctions. This research is important for several reasons. First, it provides a unique insight into mechanisms for ethnic adaptation and assimilation and, thus, is directly relevant to social issues faced by the United States today. Secondly, it will assist in the training of an extremely promising young scientist.\n",

      "a9003982 CMS $39408 The objectives of this workshop are: (1) to review the state of the art of long wave (tsunami) runup onto a coastline; (2) help identify areas where knowledge is fragmented and incomplete; (3) assist in the transfer of information between theory and practice; (4) address the issues of the maintenance of numerical codes for runup predictions, and the development of certain bench mark problems for calibration and comparison purposes; and (5) suggest future directions in tsunami runup hazard mitigation research. The attendance of tsunami researchers from Japan and the Soviet Union is an important component in the planning of the workshop. Tsunami research is very active in these countries, but due to communication difficulties, this research is not well known in the United States. Another goal of this meeting is to bring together researchers who do not normally interact. This workshop brings together coastal engineers, oceanographers, geologists and mathematicians engaged in the study of wave runup, thereby improving the communication between specialists from different scientific disciplines who work on different aspects of the runup problem. The workshop addresses the related problem of computer code maintenance: given the expense of developing new codes or of resurrecting existing ones, guidelines are needed for the maintenance of existing codes. The dissemination of these codes is also of concern. Given the current capabilities of electronic mail, it appears that this offers a convenient method of dissemination, but there is a need to agree upon protocols for governing the transfer of research codes. It is expected that this workshop will have a very positive effect on directing research toward tsunami hazard mitigation, including a more conspicuous effort to contribute to the state of the art of tsunami warning systems (which are the responsibility of the National Weather Service within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration).\n",

The program seeks to enable US scientists and engineers to conduct long-term research abroad at research institutions of proven excellence. Awards provide opportunities for the conduct of joint research, and the use of unique or complimentary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions in foreign countries. This award will support a 12 month visit by Dr. Robert D. Tilton to go to Sweden to work with Dr. Per Claesson of the Institute for Surface Chemistry on \"A Study of Adsorbed Protein Interactions Using the Surface Force Apparatus.\" Dr. Tilton plans to use the surface force apparatus to measure the force-distance relationships characterizing the intermolecular interactions experienced by adsorbed proteins. With this recently developed technique, forces as small as 10-to-the-minus-7 N are measured between opposing crossed mica cylinders at separations resolvable to less than 1nm. The extreme sensitivity of the surface force apparatus makes it useful in the study of the forces that govern the behavior of molecular and colloidal systems. This approach is especially useful to characterize non-DLVO forces, such as repulsive hydration and attractive hydrophobic forces, that are important in biological and colloidal systems. Use of the surface force apparatus to quantitatively study the character of the interactions of adsorbed proteins with surfaces and with other biomolecules will improve our understanding of the basic phenomena driving protein adsorption, and thus will assist in the development of materials that contact the biological environment. The award recommendation provides funds to cover, as appropriate, international travel, local travel abroad, stipend, dependents' allowance if applicable, and a flat administrative allowance of $250 for the U.S. home institution.\n",
      "a9003998 CMS $15000 This is a post Loma Prieta earthquake (Oct. 1989) investigation project in learning from this damaging event. This project concentrates on the seismic performance of elevators during the earthquake and relates this learning to the current elevator code requirement. A damage survey indicates that the Loma Prieta earthquake has caused extensive elevator damage, although the design details that contributed to the problems are not known. It is clear that seismic switches, optional in California but required for the National code, did not performed as intended. This earthquake provides an opportunity to identify the deficiencies of current elevator codes and improve our understanding of the seismic performance of elevators. Several buildings that experienced elevator damages will be selected to represent a range of configurations, structural systems, types of elevator equipment, and locations. A detailed inspection of elevators will be made based on damage details from expert interviews. Code provisions will be evaluated in light of observed damage and changes suggested. Finally, the malfunctions effecting the performance of seismic safety devices will be evaluated. This study will upgrade the current code requirements governing the seismic safety of elevator systems.\n",

      "a9004013 IBN $170000 Dr. Becker's laboratory is interested in the regulation of nuclear genes encoding enzymes that are involved in the process of photorespiration and localized in leaf peroxisomes. The expression of these genes is organ specific, developmentally regulated, and strongly modulated by light, as studied in emerging cucumber seedlings. He has recently isolated cDNA and genomic clones for two photorespiratory enzymes, hydroxypyruvate reductase (HPR) and serine:glyoxylate aminotransferase (SGAT), and have sequenced an HPR clone containing the entire coding region plus 2.2kb of 5' flanking sequence. Here, he proposes to confirm (by nuclear run-on studies) the transcriptional regulation suggested by prior mRNA assays and transcript analyses. He then intends to use the isolated clones to assay for cis acting regulatory elements (be deletion analysis in transgenic tobacco), trans acting factors (by gel shift and foot printing assays), and possible changes in chromatin structure accompanying both developmental and light regulation. %%% The process of photorespiration is linked to but independent of photosynthesis. The function of photorespiration for the plant is to return to the Calvin cycle three out of every four carbon atoms diverted from it by the oxygenase activity of the carbon dioxide fixing enzyme of the photosynthetic cycle. This is of major metabolic importance to the plant. The regulation of the enzymes of that pathway are the topic of the current study.\n",

      "a9004017 DMS $42800 This research project consists of two parts, both trying to study knot (link) invariants via representation varieties. The first part is a continuation of Lin's work wherein he defined a knot invariant in terms of an intersection number of subvarieties and related this knot invariant to a classical one. To generalize this work, one can define other intersection numbers and he is interested in relating these intersection numbers with classical link invariants. In the second part, he suggests a way of constructing a 2-variable polynomial for a knot in S3, generalizing the definition of the Alexander polynomial via Seifert forms. This construction is intimately related to representation varieties. In particular, it suggests a possible connection between the Jones polynomial and Casson's invariant of homology 3-spheres. Lin's hope is that this research will shed some light on some important questions, such as how to generalize the Jones polynomial from S3 to arbitrary 3-manifolds and how to interpret the Jones polynomial in terms of the topology of the knot complement. Knots in three-dimensional space are natural objects to study. The polynomials Lin describes reduce the problem of distinguishing truly inequivalent knots from different presentations of the same knot to questions about polynomials, i.e. to fairly simple algebraic problems. (This transition from geometry to algebra turns out to be related to other mathematics of no immediately apparent connection.)\n",
      "a9004018 DMS $80000 Hempel and his graduate students are engaged in several related projects concerning the topology and geometry of manifolds of dimensions two and three. The ultimate goals of this research are progress towards the classification and homeomorphism problems for 3-manifolds. The techniques involve a study of the (immersed and/or embedded) incompressible surfaces in a 3-manifold, a study of branched covering spaces, and a study of the mapping class group of surfaces. The projects include: (1) A study of the lattice of all (closed, oriented) 3-manifolds as branched covers of the 3-sphere, branched over some fixed universal link, e.g., the figure-eight knot. (2) The development of a theory of complexity for normal subgroups of fundamental groups of surfaces directed towards questions of existence, reducibility, etc. for Heegaard splittings of 3-manifolds. Three-dimensional manifolds are the next simplest geometric objects after surfaces (two-dimensional manifolds), but while surfaces have long been classified up to topological equivalence, the same problem for 3-manifolds is very much alive and obviously far more complicated.\n",
      "a9004022 MCB $6000 The purpose of this workshop is to assemble for discussions a select but representative group of scientists who are actively working at the forefront of research on the biochemical mechanisms used in site-specific recombination and transposition. This interrelated group reactions lie at the heart of a number of very important biological processes: integration of retroviruses generation of antibody diversity, transmission of antibiotic resistance genes, rearrangement of bacterial chromosomes and mobility of eukaryotic introns. The oral presentations at this Workshop will emphasize the mechanistic aspects of these recombination reactions. There is currently rapid progress in this area, and a specialized meeting for leaders in this field should be both timely and productive. The roster of speakers includes several scientists who have pushed the analysis of recombination for the first time into the realm of enzyme kinetics, as well as many scientists who have applied other types of biochemical, genetic and topological analysis. Topics will include retroviral integration, reactions of the integrase and resolvase families, Holliday junctions, immunoglobulin rearrangements, prokaryotic transposable elements, and Drosophila P elements. We are also encouraging poster presentations from scientists working in systems which are not yet amenable to mechanistic analysis. This should serve both to broaden the biological base of the meeting and to encourage those working in relatively undeveloped systems to undertake a more mechanistic approach. The meeting will be limited to 100-135 participants. This number is sufficient to include all of the principal investigators who are working productively in this area as well as a reasonable sampling of post-doctoral fellows and an occasional outstanding graduate student. However, this number is small enough that efficient interchange amongst all the participants is still possible.\n",

      "a9004024 EAR $99884 The Avalon composite terrane of the northern Appalachian orogen represent a college of tectonostratigraphic terranes that were amalgamated in the late Precambrian, accreted as a composite terrane to North America during the early-middle Paleozoic, and were subsequently dispersed variable distances relative to each other. Identification of the constituent terrane elements within the composite terrane has been controversial, their tectonothermal evolution is uncertain, and the nature and timing of amalgamation, accretion and dispersal are poorly constrained. This project will address these issue through a comprehensive structural and 40Ar/39Ar geochronological study of a representative portion of the Avalon composite terrane in southwestern New Brunswick where recent studies have shown an important late Precambrain terrane boundary may exist. Results of a reconnaissance 40Ar//39Ar isotopic survey indicate that a significant contribution can be made in the proposed study area. The project couples detailed structural mapping kinematic analysis and petrological studies with a program of 40Ar/39Ar mineral dating designed to resolve the region's tectonothermal evolution. The study will substantially improve knowledge of the nature, timing and kinematics of tectonothermal events recorded in the Avalon composite terrane and, thereby, will greatly facilitate the identification and correlation of constituent late Precambrian terranes.\n",

      "a9004030 MCB $270000 Mitochondria, whether in lower or higher eukaryotes, are endowed with the capability to translate a small number of proteins encoded by their genomes. With the exception of the transfer and ribosomal RNAs, and a single ribosomal protein, whose genes are located in mitochondrial DNA, all other components of the translational machinery are derived from nuclear genes. During the past grant period, nuclear respiratory deficient mutants of yeast affected in various aspects of mitochondrial metabolism have been isolated and characterized. Among this collection, approximately 55 complementation groups have been ascertained to be impaired in mitochondrial protein synthesis. This subset of mutants has allowed characterization of different mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, ribosomal proteins, and translational initiation and elongation factions. The analysis of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase genes have been particularly fruitful in revealing new and unsuspected evolutionary relationships between different members of this enzyme family.The studies embodied in the present proposal will provide addition insights into the nature of the mitochondrial translation system through continued biochemical and genetic analyses of respiratory deficient yeast mutants. Several objectives will be pursued in the course of these investigations. First, the PI intends to complete the characterization of other mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and to start structural studies on the lysyl-tRNA synthetase. This information will be used to further assess the evolutionary derivation of this multigene family. A second important goal is to delineate the factors responsible for regulating the expression of mitochondrial synthetases and to clarify the biochemical rationale for the existence of separate genes for some of the mitochondrial and cytoplasmic homologues. Finally they expect to work out an in vitro system of mitochondrial protein synthesis which will permit more incisive studies on the mechanism by which the products of nuclear genes such as CBP6, CBP7 (CBS2), and CBS1 facilitate translation of the cytochrome b mRNA and pre-mRNA.\n",
      "a9004041 IBN $129600 Early neurogenesis in Drosophila establishes neural and epidermal cell lineages from an apparently homogeneous ectodermal population. Recent molecular and genetic evidence has demonstrated that this process is regulated by a small number of zygotic genes, termed the neurogenic loci. One of these genes, \"mastermind (mam),\" has not been well characterized in terms of how it functions and interacts with the other neurogenic loci. The specific aims of this research will be to 1) localize mam mRNA and protein on the cellular and subcellular levels throughout development, as an aid to understanding function; 2) examine the genetic interactions between mam and other loci, determining the sequences of interesting mam mutations that affect the other loci; and 3) sequence alternative transcription products of mam to determine whether the gene codes for more than one protein, and to detect possible homologies to previously characterized molecules in invertebrates and vertebrates.\n",
      "a9004042 MCB $285000 Our long term goal is to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the genetic control of sexual development in Drosophila. Because many of the genes in the sex determination pathway are regulated by RNA processing, these studies will also contribute to our understanding of alternative RNA splicing as a means of gene regulation. Our research is focused on the sans-fille (snf) gene. Genetic studies suggest that snf plays a key role in the sexual decision making process in both the germline and the soma. To further our understanding of this newly identified gene we propose: 1) To determine whether snf is required only for sex determination or whether it has a more generalized function in development by analyzing null alleles of the locus. 2) To initiate a detailed molecular characterization of the snf gene and its products and 3) To place snf in the regulatory hierarchy of sex determination genes by a combined molecular and genetic approach. In the fruit fly Drosophila individuals with an X and a Y chromosome develop into males and those with 2X chromosomes develop into females. The decision of which developmental pathway to adopt is made during embryonic life by every cell in the body of the embryo. We have known since the early years of this century that the cells make their decision by counting the number of X chromosomes they contain, but it is only over the past decade that more of the details of the mechanism by which the decision is made have been elucidated. This is a proposal to study a recently discovered early step in this mechanism.\n",
      "a9004048 MCB $268000 Over 20 different bacterial adaptive responses to environmental stimuli are regulated by a family of proteins, response regulators, sharing a conserved amino terminal domain. The activity of these response regulators is controlled by a second family of proteins sharing a conserved domain, usually located at the carboxyl terminus. Recent experiments with the purified signal transduction proteins that control nitrogen assimilation (NTR regulon), chemotaxis (Che) and osmoregulation (OMP regulon) indicate that the proteins of this second family are protein kinases and, in some cases, phosphoprotein phosphatases that regulate the adaptive responses by controlling the level of phosphorylation of the response regulators. Of these protein kinases, the best understood is NRII which regulates nitrogen assimilation by catalyzing the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the enhancer-binding transcription factor NRI. In this proposal, the PI presents experiments designed to further elucidate the mechanisms of the kinase and phosphatase reactions catalyzed by NRII The results of these experiments will probably be applicable to all of the homologous protein kinases. NRII has three activities: in the presence of ATP, NRII is autophosphorylated on a histidine residue. This phosphoryl group is then transferred to an aspartyl residue within the N-terminal domain of the response regulator NRI. Finally, in the presence of the signal transduction protein PII and ATP, NRII catalyzes the dephosphorylation of P-NRI. Genetic experiments are proposed that should define the requirements for nucleotide binding and the autokinase, phosphotransferase. and phosphatase activities by isolating or constructing mutants specifically deficient in these activities. In addition, experiments are proposed that should directly elucidate the identity of the autophosphorylated histidine residue, the stoichiometry of autophosphorylation, and the sites of nucleotide binding.\n",
      "a9004054 MCB $355625 We shall develop the tools for introducing genes into the plastid genome of higher plants using Nicotiana tabacum, a suitable model species. Lack of plastid transformation in higher plants has been due to problems of a large plastid genome copy number in a cell, lack of appropriate selective markers, and an effective way of DNA delivery. First, we shall transform wild-type plastids with plastid 16S rRNA genes that confer resistance to antibiotics. Introduction of DNA will be by bombardment with DNA-coated tungsten particles. Transformation will result in gene replacement. Research will be extended to study the requirements of inserting foreign DNA into the plastid genome. Oligonucleotide, and gene- size segments of DNA will be linked to the selective markers. Incorporation of oligonucleotides will be used to select suitable sites for gene insertion. Larger segments of DNA will include chimeric genes. Involvement of copy correction will be determined in the formation of stable transgenic plastid genomes. Information derived from proposed research will make feasible the study of plastid gene regulation and function in transgenic plants. This research will develop a plastid transformation protocol for higher plants. This is a very important tool for further genetic engineering of plants.\n",
      "a9004057 EAR $90000 Research wil continue on the fluvial, Miocene Siwalik deposits of the Potwar Plateau in northern Pakistan. This involves construction of detailed sedimentological logs through the Chinji, Magri and Shok Pathan formations formations in several different parts of the basin where there is paleomagnetic age dating. Several important 50 to 100 m thick stratigraphic intervals in each measured sequence will be detailed sedimentologically and paleontologically over several km laterally, using photo mosaics and closely-spaced (100 m) logs. Paleosol carbonates will be sampled for Carbon isotope analysis. This will allow us to reconstruct the temporally and spatially varying paleoenvironments in terms of paleochannel geometry and hydraulics, nature of paleosols, animal and plant activity and deposition rates. Particular attention will be paid to: (1) the upper Shok Pathan Formation (6mpBP) where there is evidence for a major climatic, vegetational and faunal change and (2) the Chinji-Nagri transition (10 m.y.B.P.) where there is evidence of a major faunal turnover, increasing depositional rates, increasing proportion and grain size of channel deposits, and increasing channel size, but no evidence of a climatic change. It will then be possible to understand an important period of evolution of land organisms in relation to changes in the physical and chemical environment. This study will also have more general implications for the relationship between fluvial deposits (and the fossils they contain), tectonism and climate.\n",

In contrast with previous work, the formalism is completely relativistic and preserves the full finite range character of the reaction processes. Subsequently the (p,np) and (e,e'p) reactions will be examined. The results will provide a better understanding of nucleon knockout reactions and the nature of the strong interaction in a nuclear medium.\n",
      "a9004062 DMS $328350 Two senior investigators and two postdocs will study various aspects of differential geometry and Riemann surfaces. One will establish the finiteness of string theories to all orders of perturbation theory. This will require the development of holomorphic supergeometry and new parametrizations of Teichmuller space suggested by Feynman diagrams. The second investigator will work on problems in complex differential geometry. This will include a study of Hermitian symmetric domains, holomorphic mappings between them, and their classification. One postdoc will analyze homomorphic immersions between compact complex hyperbolic space forms. The second will derive further estimates for eigenvalues of manifolds with conelike singularities. Four investigators will study various aspects of differential geometry. Several of the problems to be studied have their origins in string theory. This theory has been used to describe complex interactions between elementary particles. In this theory, each particle is represented by a string which vibrates in ten dimensional space. These investigations are part of a continuing effort by mathematicians and physicists to use this new theory to explain the results of high-energy particle experiments.\n",
      "a9004063 BCS $127152 Because the composition of bone collagen is affected by diet, paleoanthropologists have used analyses of both trace elements and isotopic ratios in skeletal remains in an attempt to reconstruct patterns of subsistence. In particular, this approach has been employed to study the adoption of maize agriculture among North American Indians. Changes in hypothesized diets have then been correlated with changes in social organization. Because maize has a slightly different ratio of carbon isotopes from most native North American vegetation, paleoanthropologists have used variation in carbon 12/13 ratios as an indicator of the amount of maize in the diet. While, from an empirical perspective, the results appear reasonable, many details of the system are not fully understood. Dr. Margaret Schoeninger's work is directed to filling in the blanks. Dr. Schoeninger will carry out a number of related activities. She will study modern samples of prehistoric strains and determine isotope ratios. She will then subject such samples to burning and other diagenetic factors to see if they affect the ratio. She will also analyze a series of materials recovered from archaeological sites which also contain maize remains. Bone collagen stable isotope ratios will be determined. Maize kernels will then be analyzed for overall isotopic composition, as well as the isotopic composition of individual biochemical components and individual amino acids. This research is important for several reasons. First, it will help to develop techniques which may be used to investigate a number of archaeological situations. Secondly, it will increase our understanding of U.S. prehistory. Finally, because the project includes students, it will assist in the training of young scientists.\n",
      "a9004064 BCS $7960 Under the direction of Dr. Vaughn Bryant, Ms. Kristin Sobolik will analyze archaeological materials and comparative samples which will provide the basis for her doctoral dissertation. The project focuses on the subsistence adaptation of Archaic peoples, early hunters and gatherers, who lived in the Lower Pecos Region (Texas) of the Chihuahuan Desert. It utilizes two approaches. Ms. Sobolik will visit this research area in each of the four major seasons and conduct biological surveys to determine the types and the densities of resources available. She will also collect samples which will provide a comparative base for the identification of archaeological materials. Secondly, she will examine archaeological remains, stored at the Texas Archaeological Research Laboratories in Austin, from a number of Pecos sites. She will combine the results of faunal, floral, and coprolite analyses with data drawn from skeletal studies of prehistoric inhabitants to delineate Archaic subsistence patterns and draw inferences about paleodiet. The archaeological sites in the Lower Pecos region are of interest for several reasons. First, although a large number have been carefully excavated over the last several decades, much of the material has not been analyzed. This is unfortunate because in this desert region preservation is excellent. Plant remains which can serve both to reconstruct diet and environment are abundant and such situations are rare. The archaeology of the region is also important because the long prehistoric record documents how technologically simple populations adapted to and survived in a harsh and variable desert environment. Ms. Sobolik's research will synthesize a broad range of data from a number of sites. This project is important for several other reasons as well. Methodologically it is valuable because it explores how very diverse data sets may be drawn together and analyzed to yield nutritional information. If successful it will provide a model which may be applied in other regions of the world. The work will also assist in the training of an extremely promising young scientist.\n",
      "a9004067 CTS $142000 A versatile NMR probe has been designed and constructed. This probe is capable of performing low signal to noise spin- lattice relaxation and diffusion coefficient measurements at pressures up to 600 atm over a temperature range of -20 to 200oC. The probe is also configured so that vapor liquid equilibrium can be established in the sample at these temperatures and pressures. In the immediate future the probe will be used to measure relaxation times (T1) and self diffusion coefficients in 13CO2 as a function of temperature and pressure. The only T1 measurements on this important fluid are the four isochores measured by Smith and coworkers (1986). Several investigators have measured the self- diffusion coefficient of CO2 over the temperature range accessible to the probe, but the measurements are confined to pressures less than 200 atm. After the pure CO2 measurements, mixtures of CO2 and n-hexadecane will be studied. This data will then be correlated with classical transport properties. This type of correlation remains relatively unexplored for mixtures. A global corresponding states treatment will also be attempted throughout this project. NMR can supply a wealth of information about the motions of molecules in all phases of matter. From the relaxation times, the rotational and translational motions may be investigated. The diffusion coefficients, measured by the spin-echo method, provide a means to investigate translational motions. In the past several years NMR imaging has been established as a valuable tool in the investigation of fluid flow in porous media. A major challenge in the usefulness of this technique lies in relating the NMR measurables to traditional thermodynamic and transport properties. The interrelationship is shown in Figure 1. The purpose of our current NMR program, is to further develop and quantify some of the relationships between NMR measurables, transport properties, and state variables. One area which would benefit greatly from the development of these relationships is the interpretation and quantification of NMR images. Practical use of NMR imaging requires a correlation to bridge the NMR data with traditional engineering analysis.\n",
      "a9004068 MCB $196142 In higher plants, the mechanism by which potassium is transported across the plasma membrane is uncertain. Results from electrophysiological and biochemical studies suggest a model in which a proton pump (H+ -ATPase) generates a proton electrochemical gradient which drives potassium uptake through potassium carriers and channels. By isolating and characterizing mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana with altered potassium transport, this model is being tested. Preliminary experiments indicate that cesium is a phytotoxic competitive inhibitor of potassium uptake in A. thaliana seedlings. From 100,000 M2 seed, several dozen cesium-resistant A. thaliana mutant plants were isolated and many display a defect in potassium transport. The mutants showed two broad phenotypic groupings, one which is pleiotropic in that potassium and phosphate transport are both affected, and a second in which a specific alteration has occurred in the affinity of the transport system for potassium. The second set of mutants is being characterized genetically. In order to clone and sequence genes encoding plasma membrane potassium transporters, a chromosome walk to loci of uptake mutants with altered affinities for potassium is being performed. Potassium plays a special role in the life of plant cells. The accumulation of high concentrations of this ion drives the uptake of water without an increase in cell volume because the plasma membrane is restrained in its expansion by a rigid cell wall. Thus, the main function for accumulated potassium appears to be the generation and maintenance of a large turgor pressure. In higher plants this pressure plays an especially important role in providing the driving force for erect plant growth through cell elongation. The concentration of potassium in the cytoplasm of cells is maintained even when the extracellular concentration is reduced to extremely low levels. It has long been recognized that the generation and maintenance of this large potassium gradient requires metabolic energy. This research explores the molecular mechanism for potassium transport across the plasma membrane of plants in order to gain a better understanding of how this important plant mineral functions in plant growth and development.***//\n",
      "a9004073 CHE $325000 Professor William Steele is supported by a grant from The Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to perform computer simulations of many-body dynamics in liquids. The proposed calculations are important as an aid to understanding molecular motion in liquids and the effects of this motion on the observed infrared, Raman, and depolarized light scattering spectra. Computer simulations based on realistic intermolecular interaction potentials will be employed to give representations of actual molecules, chosen so that experimental data are available for comparison. Properties to be studied depend on the translational and rotational motion of the molecules which composed the liquids. These properties include: far and near infrared spectra; Raman and depolarized light scattering spectra; thermal transport coefficients; and nuclear spin dipole-dipole relaxation times. Theory indicates that these phenomena involve two-, three-, and four-body dynamical contributions. Steele proposes to study the relative magnitudes and timescales for each of these many-body contributing factors. Molecules proposed for study range from simple molecules such as carbon monoxide up to relatively complex ones such as ethyl hexyl benzoate where there is competition between intramolecular reorientation and whole-molecule motions.\n",
      "a9004076 DMS $53100 The principal investigator will expand upon his recent discovery of new homotopy-theoretic structures on complex surfaces. This interdisciplinary project involves the use of algebraic topology to understand the structure of the solution space of certain systems of nonlinear partial differential equations which appear naturally in differential geometry and mathematical physics. Additionally, he will investigate several problems involving iterated loop space structures. Two shapes are homotopic if closed loops on them have identical collapsing properties. For example, a circle and the shape of a solid coffee mug (with one handle) are homotopy equivalent. But if the mug were to have two handles or no handles, it would not be homotopy equivalent to a circle. This concept has been explored by mathematicians for over a hundred years, but its use in problems related to mathematical physics has been a recent phenomena. The principal investigator will contribute to this growing interdisciplinary activity.\n",
      "a9004078 DMS $36522 The work undertaken in this project concerns partial differential equations of hyperbolic type. These equations are frequently used to model wave phenomena occurring the physical universe. Examples can be found in the theories of elasticity, elementary particle physics and general relativity. The general paradigm for studying a class of hyperbolic equations is to show first the existence of what are known as weak solutions, to establish properties of these solutions and then examine the large time behavior of the solutions. In the last context, one looks for stationary or static solutions through a conversion of the (now time-independent) equation to elliptic form. This research will focus on nonlinear waves described by equations whose primary nonlinear term (as distinct from the fundamental wave equation) is a power of the modulus of the solution. At issue is whether solutions can be shown to exist for all time or will singularities develop? It turns out that a nonlinearity equal to the fifth power of the solution is the critical exponent for existing theory. For all values less than five, regularity obtains. Recent work provides proof of the regularity even at the critical value. Current work will now be confined to equations involving higher powers of the nonlinearity. Past methods will definitely not work here. Other investigations will be carried out on the wave equation in curved space-time to determine whether the energy of the solution decays locally in space and on Hamiltonian systems that are invariant under the action of a Lie group. Analysis of these systems will be directed toward a better understanding of the stability of periodic solutions.\n",

      "a9004085 MCB $138000 This research elucidates mechanisms of sustained mycelial growth of the wood-decaying fungus, Schizophyllum commune. The first phase of the project involves characterization of proteolytic enzyme systems involved in intramycelial protein turnover and recycling during nitrogen-limited growth. This problem is being addressed by purifying several proteases found in control and nitrogen-starved colonies. Subsequent classification of these enzymes is being based on biochemical characteristics, substrate and inhibitor specificity, and subcellular localization. An investigation for potential ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis also is being performed. The second phase provides initial data for studying the regulation of the nitrogen-stress response. Antibodies are being generated to specific proteases which are differentially expressed. These antibodies are to be used to assess levels of expression during nitrogen-stress and to analyze mutants for deficiencies in specific protease production. In vivo and in vitro translation products for control and nitrogen- stressed colonies are being analyzed. In addition, the potential for using heterologous cDNA probes for some specific protease messages is being investigated. This project complements other Schizophyllum research and provides a fungal system in which nutrient-stress related autolysis can be studied in the absence of sexual differentiation. Schizophyllum commune is a model system for studying biological processes in basidiomycetes and other fungi. Because it is a wood-decayer in nature, results from the proposed research should lead to a better understanding of other, more economically important wood-decaying fungi. Such fungi are of interest either because of their capability to destroy wood building materials or for their potential in biomass conversion of agricultural waste materials. It is thought that nitrogen is the limiting factor in the natural growth substrate for wood-decayers, thus our understanding of nitrogen nutrition of these organisms may lead to better methods for their control in the first instance or better methods and/or genetically engineered strains for cultivation in the latter.\n",
      "a9004086 CMS $58344 The objective of this research program is to develop a comprehensive data base on the modulus and damping characteristics of surficial soils in the Mississippi embayment region - which is recognized as a high seismic hazard area associated with the historic New Madrid earthquakes of 1811-12. The New Madrid seismic zone (NMSZ), located at the northern edge of the embayment, is well known for its seismically active buried faults. The earthquakes that occur in the NMSZ are characterized by a long recurrence period and low seismic wave attenuation (the effect of an earthquake is felt at large distances from the epicenter). The damaging effects of earthquakes are intimately associated with the dynamic properties of the surficial soils, most notably the stiffness and damping properties. These properties are a major component to regional seismic risk assessment studies. The damage is most often a result of amplification of the ground surface shaking as a result of the coincidence between a natural mode of the soil profile and the dominant frequency of incident seismic waves; or of the liquefaction of water-saturated granular deposits near the ground surface. The dynamic soil properties for the data base come from several sources: the laboratory test program; data and soil samples provided by local sources; and field work to collect special soil samples. The data have many applications in earthquake hazard mitigation, including the design of earthquake resistant structures, the retrofit of existing structures, and revision of the current building codes for the urban development projects in the Mid-south.\n",

The technique, currently used by them and by one group in Germany, combines ellipsometric measurement of coverage with vapor pressure measurement by conventional capacitance manometers or by modified manometers operating at low temperature adjacent to the sample. Among the phenomena which will be studied are surface roughening and surface melting behavior of krypton, xenon, and methane films on graphite, including detailed examination of the layer critical points and inverse critical points which occur in fourth and higher layers, at least for krypton; exploration of the phase diagrams of neon and hydrogen in the same thickness range; and wetting and layering behavior of other interesting systems, such as carbon monoxide on graphite. Other substrates will be examined besides graphite, including TiS2, TaSe2, and other layered dichalcogenides, cleaved surfaces of ionic crystals such as LiF and MgO, and gold films evaporated on mica.

      "a9004111 INT $16490 This award will support Professor Harold Scheraga of Cornell University and Professor George Nemethy of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in a research collaboration with Professor Adriana Zagari of the University of Naples, Italy. The purpose of the collaboration is the determination of the preferred conformations of several short peptides that form structurally and functionally important parts of proteins. Two specific problems will be investigated. The first problem is that of the nonhelical telopeptides of collagen. These peptides play an important role in directing and stabilizing the particular manner of assembly of collagen, by means of specific interactions with neighboring molecules in aggregates. The second problem concerns several peptides that occur in bovine pancreatic and seminal ribonucleases and have been proposed to play a role in the folding process of these molecules. The aim of both of these investigations is to establish the nature of the interactions of the peptides with the rest of the protein molecule and thereby understand their role in the folding and assembly of native proteins. Preferred conformations of the peptides will be determined by conformational energy computations, X-ray crystallography, and NMR and fluorescence measurements. Interatomic inter- actions between molecules in aggregates will be modeled by energy computations. Peptide synthesis and solution physicochemical measurements will be carried out in Scheraga's laboratory at Cornell. Crystallization and X-ray structural determination will be done by Zagari in Napoli. Conformational energy computations will be carried out by all three groups, coordinated by Nemethy at Mount Sinai. The planning of the project and the interpretation of the results will require the combination of theoretical and experimental approaches.\n",

If the network is represented by a set of flow equations, its behavior can then be described by the exact solution of these equations. Finding this solution is, in general, an undecidable question, Instead, one can propose and verify an approximate solution to the equations. The approximate solution is conservative. Thus, it can be used later to verify that the network's behavior satisfies a number of desirable properties, such as freedom from deadlocks.\n",
      "a9004123 DMS $66850 This award supports the research of Professor Louis Billera of Cornell University. Dr. Billera's proposed work is in the areas of convex polytopes and multivariate splines, and will involve the use of algebraic and combinatorial methods to attack fundamental questions in each of these areas. Professor Billera's work is unusually interdisciplinary within mathematics, with roots in the applied field of spline functions as well as in the most abstract parts of commutative and homological algebra, algebraic geometry, and combinatorics. A spline is a thin strip of metal or wood that one may grasp at both ends and manipulate to form a smooth curve that not only passes through two points (the places where it is held), but does so in a given direction at each point. The spline functions of concern to Professor Billera generally describe smooth shapes of dimension greater than one, and with a smoother junction at the edges than can be gotten, in the case of physical splines, by holding the two strips together in the hand. They are of interest not only within mathematics, but in design, especially of automobiles and airplanes, and in solving problems in computer graphics.\n",

      "a9004129 IBN $336000 This award provides further funding for Dr. S. F. Yang, to enable him to continue his research on ethylene biosynthesis. Assisted by other NSF-supported younger collaborators, Yang has demonstrated that ethylene is synthesized from methionine via S- adenosylmethionine and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid. The principal objectives of the project now to be carried out by Dr. Yang are (a) to purify fully and characterize 1- aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase and to determine the amino acid sequence around the active site of this enzyme isolated from apples and other plant tissues, (b) to clone the gene for this enzyme from apples, (c) to characterize the inactivation of the synthase by S-adenosylmethionine in relation to the enzyme's in vivo turnover, and (d) to characterize enzymes involved in the so-called methionine cycle. Ethylene is a plant hormone responsible for the control of numerous aspects of plant growth and development. This hormone is commercially important in agriculture and in relation to post- harvest crop physiology. The work to be pursued here is aimed at obtaining basic knowledge that can later be used as a basis for manipulating the levels of ethylene in plants, either upward or downward. This is a promising approach to optimizing certain agricultural systems. Dr. Yang's studies will provide a useful theoretical basis from which ethylene production by crop plants can be regulated via biotechnology.\n",
      "a9004133 EAR $132200 A recently published isotopic study of the precaldera rhyolites of Glass Mountain, Long Valley, has shown that the timing of differentiation of rhyolitic magma can be determined from Rb-Sr dating and resolved from the age of eruption (as determined by K- Ar ages). Furthermore, the differences are difficult to explain unless the rhyolitic magmas persisted in the upper reaches of the chamber in stable, stratified zones for long periods, of the order of 105 to 106 years, with negligible mass transfer between the different layers. Such protracted residence periods are considerably in excess of the estimates implied by recently published thermal modelling of the longevity of high-level silicic magma chambers. This project is to extend this research to a comprehensive study of the mineral-glass Rb-Sr systematics and 40Ar-39Ar ages of the Glass mountain rhyolites and to develop similar research on other young silicic systems. The additional volcanic centers which have been selected are Coso (California), Mineral Mountains, Twin Peaks and Honeycomb Hills (Utah), La Primavera (Mexican Volcanic Belt) and Naivasha (Kenya). These particular volcanic centers were chosen because they contain pristine rhyolitic glasses ranging in composition from metaluminous to highly peralkaline with high Rb/Sr ratios, and have already been well characterized in terms of field relations, age, chemistry and petrography.\n",

      "a9004137 IIS $145000 While considerable progress has been made in the past three years on the static typechecking of object-oriented languages, object- oriented databases pose additional problems. In particular we need to clarify the relationship between type and extent. The relationship EMPLOYEE < PERSON as a relationship between classes or types says something about the inheritance of methods, while in a database context it also means set inclusion. There is an apparent contradiction: how can a set of one type be a subset of a set of some other type? The use of \"partially dynamic\" types is investigated in order to resolve this issue, which will allow us to deal with heterogeneous collections in a statically typed system. The rules for type checking for heterogeneous collections appear to be closely related to those already developed for manipulating relational databases. If this is the case, then type inference should also be possible. Research plan includes development of a prototype language that demonstrates the feasibility of these ideas.\n",
      "a9004139 MCB $246000 The research proposed focusses on the biochemical characterization of nucleotide-protein interactions required for maintenance of the 2-5A synthetase/RNase L pathway, a vital process in cellular antiviral defense. RNase L is distinctive among nucleases in its dependence on 2- 5A for activation and cleavage specificity at uridylate residues. The molecular mechanism of 2-5A in the binding and activation of RNase L will be examined. To this end, The Pi chemically synthesized a new class of metabolically stable agonists and antagonists of 2-5A to study the biochemical processes for RNA hydrolysis in vitro and in vivo. Transmembrane passage of the 2', 5`-phosphorothioates into virus infected cells will be accomplished by poly(L-lysine) conjugation and the effect of these probes on the stability of viral and cellular mRNA will be measured. In addition, experiments are designed to examine (i) the order of addition of the substrate and allosteric activator to RNase L needed for productive complex formation, (ii) the requirement for complementary base pairing between 2-5A and RNA for RNase L activation, and (iii) the contribution of each 2', 5'- phosphodiester bond in 2-5A to the binding and activation processes of RNase L. Finally, mono- and bifunctional nucleotide site-directed affinity labels have been synthesized to study the acceptor and 2' -adenylation sites of recombinant 40 kDA, homogeneously pure 100 kDa and 110 kDa 2-5A synthetases, the ATP binding site of protein kinase, and the 2-5A binding site of RNase L.\n",
      "a9004142 DEB $10000 The coast of South Carolina received a direct hit from hurricane Hugo in late September of 1989. In addition to major economic loss, the native plants were severely damaged from wind, salinity and flooding. The next year or two represent a unique opportunity to examine the effects of a hurricane on coastal plants to determine if or how quickly they recover and to asses their role in stabilizing the coast. Dr. Young will investigate changes in an ecologically important coastal shrub, wax myrtle (Myrica cerifera), based on photosynthetic responses to the storm and the post-hurricane environment. The research is designed to take advantage of existing data and to support other proposed studies of hurricane damage. At two month intervals over the next year, photosynthesis of wax myrtle leaves and bark will be measured at three sites differing in the extent of hurricane damage at north Inlet of South Carolina. In addition, a greenhouse experiment with potted plants will separate the effects of salt damage and water-logged soils on wax myrtle photosynthesis using environmental conditions measured after the storm. These experiments will determine how quickly wax myrtle recovers after a hurricane and will provide insight into the value of wax myrtle for reducing coastal erosion from storms.\n",
      "a9004143 EAR $14304 This project consists of testing a model; the model includes results and techniques from rock mechanics, chemistry and numerical analysis and constitutes a new direction in theoretical geochemistry. It deals with alternating bedding features in argillaceous carbonate rocks that have either formed from unbedded argillaceous limestones or have had initial layering very strongly enhanced by deformation. Excellent observational data are available on natural rocks for comparison with the results of the model. A succesful model would greatly improve our ability to understand what textural changes a rock may undergo due to deformation.\n",
      "a9004147 EAR $34922 Discordant Cretaceous paleomagnetic directions observed in plutons of the North Cascades and the Coast Mountains Batholith indicate major tectonic disturbance subsequent to magnetization. Several lines of geological evidence suggest that consistent and large-scale tilting has affected intrusive rocks of this Mesozoic plutonic welt along the western margin of North America from the North Cascades to southeast Alaska. This may be a fundamental tectonic process the scope of which has not been previously appreciated. The Bell Island pluton is a 90 Ma pluton on the western flank of the Coast Mountain Batholith north of Ketchikan in southeast Alaska. Extensive structural, petrologic, and isotopic data indicate that the Bell Island pluton experienced 25o of northeast-side-up tilting in the 90 Ma to 50 Ma interval. This pluton provides an excellent opportunity to study the paleomagnetic and geologic record resulting from tilting of a large panel of crust and the tectonic processes involved in regional-scale tilting. This study is a combined geologic and paleomagnetic investigation along a southwest to northeast transect across the Bell Island pluton. The research could provide crucial information towards: (1) resolution of the northwards transport - versus - crustal tilting debate regarding discordant Cretaceous paleomagnetic directions (and therefore determination of a Cretaceous paleogeography for North America); and (2) determination of the importance of tilting of crustal panels in the tectonic evolution of North America.\n",
      "a9004149 DMS $314133 The primary areas of investigation in this project are studies of potential theory in several complex variables and complex differential geometry related to manifolds in the space of several complex variables. Work in potential theory concerns the analysis of plurisubharmonic functions arising as solutions of a partial differential equation given by the complex Monge-Ampere operator. The plurisubharmonic functions are the basic building blocks for potential theory. They arise as solutions of Monge-Ampere equations. However, there are many unanswered questions regarding the nature of the Monge-Ampere operator which impede development of a plurisubharmonic theory. They include determining whether or not the plurisubharmonic functions form the natural domains of Monge-Ampere operator and establishing the boundedness of solutions of the inhomogeneous Monge-Ampere equation when the forcing term is a Borel measure. Work will also be done studying the analytic and geometric properties of complex manifolds and their boundaries, specifically Cauchy-Riemann manifolds. Certain renormalized characteristic classes, finite on strictly pseudoconvex domains, have been identified. They have proved effective in showing that the Chern form for Kahler-Einstein surfaces is a nonnegative (2,2) form. From this follows the remarkable fact that the integral of this Chern form can be broken into a part only dependent on the boundary topology. Work is now proceeding to determine the set of all renormalized characteristic classes, that is, global integrals of Chern-Weyl polynomials of curvature tensors of Kahler-Einstein metrics which are finite.\n",
      "a9004152 EAR $365000 This grant is for continuing operation of the campus part of the Berkeley Center for Isotope Geochemistry. The research emphasis is on using isotopic and trace element measurements to elucidate the nature of solid earth geochemical cycles; in particular the focus is on processes related to the differentiation and evolution of continental lithosphere and its relationship to the structure and evolution of the mantle. The research includes field, laboratory, experimental and theoretical components. Analytical work includes measurements of isotope ratios of Ca, Nd, Sr, Pb, O and H on geological materials using clean chemistry laboratories and high precision mass spectrometric measurements. Activities proposed for the grant period are: (1) measurements of Ca isotopic ratios in island arc rocks and continental granitic rocks; (2) studies of crustal and mantle xenoliths in a transect from unrifted to recently extended craton to establish the nature of deep lithospheric modification during extension; (3) studies of the temporal evolution of basalt source regions during continental extension; (4) pilot studies of granitic petrogenesis in the USSR; (5) mathematical modelling of fluid-rock interaction and magmatic processes.\n",

      "a9004163 DMS $44000 This project involves the use of surgery theory to study symmetries of manifolds, with emphasis on finite groups of symmetries of the sphere. The project includes four parts. The first part studies the role of the rational numbers in geometric topology and surgery theory, and in particular aims at the determination of the rational homotopy types of manifolds with finite fundamental group. The second part involves a mix of knot theory and high-dimensional techniques, and this mix could lead to an interesting synthesis. The third part examines connections between group actions and numerical invariants in L-theory, which in turn leads to number theory. Finally the last part is algebraic considerations in L-theory and Galois cohomology. Such interactions between algebra and topology have been quite fruitful in the past.\n",
      "a9004164 BCS $123443 The late Iron Age site of Kelheim, located at the confluence of the Altmuhl and Danube rivers in Bavaria, Germany, covers an area of approximately 600 hectares of land and is enclosed by a wall about 3300 meters long. It provides mute testimony to the size and complexity of European \"cities\" which existed before Julius Caesar and his Roman legions marched northward and conquered large portions of Western Europe. While archaeologists have known for some time that such indigenous sites existed little is understood about how they developed and functioned. This project, under the direction of Dr. Peter Wells, will shed new light on this process. Following a preliminary season of excavation, Dr. Wells and his colleagues will now conduct an additional two field seasons of work at Kelheim. They will open broad horizontal areas to expose structural and artifactual remains. They will analyze the artifacts they recover, as well as associated floral and faunal materials. Large heaps of iron slag indicate that large scale metal production was carried out, and the team's research will also focus on this. Slag and iron samples will be collected and subjected to laboratory analysis to provide insight into the manufacturing process. Archaeologists wish to know how these early sites were organized and the extent to which a strong central authority existed. By examination of the spatial distribution of activities across the site as well as the degree of standardization of manufactured remains, this question can be addressed. This research is important for several reasons. It will provide additional information on a little-understood aspect of European prehistory. It will shed new light on how complex societies such as our own first arose and were maintained. Finally, it will contribute to the training of several graduate students.\n",
      "a9004168 DBI $31795 The mathematical theory of sets first developed in response to deep problems in the foundations of the calculus and the theory of functions. After considerable initial success, progress in these areas came to an abrupt halt and an number of natural open problems stubbornly resisted solution. The explanation came only later; in fact, these problems cannot be answered on the basis of the standard axioms. This discovery led to a search for new axioms, and today's set theorists are faced with two distinct theories, theories that provide opposing answers to many of the previously open problems. The question of which of these theories is true is not strictly mathematical; one isn't looking for a proof. Previous axioms were judged on their purported \"obviousness\", but the current candidates enjoy no such status. Thus a novel methodological problem arises: how can such hypotheses be judged? Professor Maddy's goal is to provide a philosophical analysis of the nature of this question -- is such-and-such a an axiom candidate true? -- and to delineate that range of methods appropriate to answering it. She will then apply these methods to one particular new axiom candidate: the assumption that all sets are constructible. This research is of great importance for the philosophy of science and foundational studies of mathematics.\n",
      "a9004169 MCB $270000 The present proposal is centered on the study of two classes vof Staphylococcus aureus host mutants which affect the replication of plasmid pT181. The studies conducted so far on the characterization of these two classes of mutants have shown that both illustrate new types of host-plasmid interactions. The first class of mutations, exemplified by pcrA3, maintain plasmid pT181 at a reduced copy number, without dramatically affecting its hereditary stability. The pcrA mutations does not act by interfering with the plasmid control mechanism, and its effect can not be explained simply by a host factor limiting for plasmid replication. It was shown that in the pcrA host there is an accumulation of the plasmid pT181 Rep-origin replication initiation complex. These results suggest that the pcrA gene product enables the plasmid replication initiation complex to make efficient use of the host enzymatic machinery for replication. Several classes of plasmid mutations that affect the response to the pcrA3 mutation have been isolated and characterized. A more detailed study of the pcrA3 mutations is proposed which will include in vivo and in vitro replication experiments as well as genetical studies. Work is in progress for the cloning of the pcrA gene. This will permit us to evaluate its role in the cell and will contribute to the understanding of the way in which it affects plasmid pT181 replication. The mutation placC1, representative of the second class which leads to the maintenance of plasmid pT181 at much increased copy number, was found to specifically affect the control mechanism of this plasmid, by depressing the synthesis of the countertranscripts ( ctRNA), which act as negative effectors. The placC gene has been cloned and its sequencing is in progress. The cloned wild type allele was found to complement the placC1 allele present on the chromosome preventing the amplification of plasmid pT181. The isolation of the plaC gene makes possible the study of its role in host metabolism and of the way in which its expression is regulated. The results to be obtained will help to determine what is the biological significance of the dependence of the pT181 ctRNA promoter upon the function of the plaC gene.\n",
      "a9004170 IBN $254989 This proposal will test two working models which explain the relationship between phosphorylation of the two sperm specific basic nuclear proteins (Sp histones) of the sea urchin, chromatin structural alterations and male nuclear decondensation. The first model postulates that the phosphorylation of specific tetrapeptide sites in these proteins alters physical properties such as thermal stability, nuclease accessibility, average nucleosomal repeat length and histone DNA binding affinities that reveal how the histones and DNA are arranged. The experiments are designed to assess the contribution of each Sp histone separately. Measurements will be made on chromatin reconstituted from purified histones and DNA in the absence of complicating factors present in the living cell. The results will elucidate some of the alterations on first order chromatin structure observed in vivo. The second model addresses the potential consequences of Sp histone phosphorylation upon male chromatin decondensation and postulates at least two requirements for decondensation: phosphorylation and activation of a factor(s) sensitive to the drug 6-dimethylaminopurine. Using microinjection of condensed nuclei differing in their degree of phosphorylation, several factors will be evaluated including the role of Sp histone phosphorylation in decondensation, and the role of other metabolic activities. The factors absent in immature oocytes will be investigated, and an assay will be developed for the decondensation factor(s) which are sensitive to the drug. The consequences of phosphorylation at the specific tetrapeptide sites are unlikely to be restricted to sea urchin male germ cells. Similar sites are known in most H1 histones and in several nucleic acid packaging proteins and regulators, emphasizing the general importance of studying their phosphorylation. %%% The long term objective of this research is an understanding of the inactivation/activation of the sperm nucleus which occurs during spermatogenesis and following fertilization. The successful genetic reactivation of the dormant sperm nucleus by egg cytoplasm, following fertilization, is essential to successful biparental embryonic development.\n",
      "a9004171 DEB $117170 The evolution of synapsids is documented by an unusually rich fossil record, extending over 300 million years. Primitive synapsids, the pelycosaurs, are the most conspicuous terrestrial vertebrates of their time, and their fossil remains record the earliest successful adaptive radiation of amniotes to a broad array of herbivorous and predators modes of life. The PIs will undertake a thorough reassessment of the phylogenetic relationships of pelycosaurs by combining detailed anatomical studies of specimens with a cladistic analysis that considers a large suite of characters. Their first hand knowledge of this group, previous studies of numerous pelycosaur taxa, and availability of representative specimens of three outgroups for direct osteological comparisons will eliminate the need to rely heavily on outdated literature. In addition to providing an assessment of the ingroup relationships of pelycosaurs, the present study will assess the relationship of pelycosaurs to other Paleozoic vertebrates, including their therapsid descendants. Computer algorithms that utilize cladistic techniques will be used to analyze phylogenetic relationships. This project will provide a solid basis for the analysis of the paleoecology and paleobiogeography of pelycosaurs. The PIs also expect to be able to construct a macroevolutionary model of the group and to address the perplexing problem of the origin of amniotes (higher vertebrates that include recent reptiles, birds, and mammals).\n",
      "a9004176 MCB $273100 We will determine the relative timing of genetic recombination and chromosome pairing in normal strains of the fungus Coprinus cinereus. We will ask if the presence of flanking insertion/deletion heterozygosities alters the timing or amount of exchange in the test interval. We will examine recombination in the test interval using strains that fail to complete chromosome pairing due to the presence of the rad3-1 mutation. We will also monitor the timing of genetic exchange between homologous sequences that are located at non-homologous positions in the genome. The specificity of meiotic chromosome pairing is not known. It has been suggested that some aspects of the recombination mechanism might provide this specificity, but evidence to test these models is lacking. Such models would predict that exchange should precede or occur simultaneously with pairing, but not follow pairing. Such models also predict the occurrence of mutant strains that are recombination-proficient but pairing deficient. These two predictions will be tested in the experiments proposed here. The results will provide an important framework for understanding the molecular basis of homologue recognition in meiotic prophase. All living organisms have mechanisms to ensure that their genetic information, packaged in their chromosomes is passed from one generations to the next in a faithful and orderly way. This is a proposal to resolve some important long-standing questions about the nature of these mechanisms.\n",

      "a9004184 EAR $100000 The proposed program of research is designed to improve our understanding of the chemical evolution of seawater during the last 600 m.y. of Earth history. To accomplish this, we plan to extend our analytical data base for the chemical composition of brines in fluid inclusions trapped in halite (NaCl) in marine evaporites. Many of these brines are samples of the solutions from which the salt precipitated. In marine evaporites these brines are largely or entirely derived from seawater; their composition therefore reflects the composition of seawater at the time of salt precipitation. In many instances the evolution of these brines from seawater has been so complicated, that little information regarding the composition of the parent seawater can be gained from the composition of the inclusion fluids. Fortunately, the evolution of the brines in some marine evaporites has been sufficiently simple, so that much of the chemistry of the starting seawater can be reconstructed. The data accumulated to date indicate that the composition of seawater has been surprisingly conservative during the past 600 m.y. At present these data are still fragmentary. We propose to extend them considerably, and to construct a reasonably complete record of the composition of seawater during the Phanerozoic Eon.\n",

      "a9004191 IBN $285000 Calcium ions and cytoskeleton contribute importantly to the process of pollen tube growth. A calcium gradient located at the tip of the pollen tube may control the fusion of incoming vesicles, while the microfilament cytoskeleton appears to move the vesicles to the tip. The proposed project will further explore the role these factors play in tip growth, and in addition examine the impact of calcium ion on the cytoskeleton and vice versa. Dr. Hepler will measure the gradient in free calcium ion using ratiometric fluorescent dyes that have been microinjected in single pollen tubes. He will determine the extracellular inward calcium current using a ion specific vibrating electrode. He will explore the detailed ultrastructure of the cytoskeleton in pollen tubes that have been prepared by rapid freeze fixation-freeze substitution. Finally, he will identify the cytoskeletal components at the electron microscope level using gold tagged antibodies. The above analytical methods when applied to cells cultured under experimental conditions that block elongation through perturbation of either the calcium ion gradient or cytoskeletal function may provide important new information about the control of growth and polarity in developing pollen tubes. %%% Understanding how the pollen tube of plants grows could have important impact on plant breeding in agriculture and horticulture.\n",

      "a9004202 DMS $16200 Michael Falk will continue his research into the interplay of combinatorics and algebra with the topology of the complement of an arrangement of hyperplanes over the field of complex numbers. The emphasis will be on two related problems: the classification problem, and the K(pi,1) problem. The classification centers on the following question and its converse: is the topology of the complement of an arrangement determined by the intersection pattern of the original hyperplanes? The K(pi,1) problem asks for necessary and/or sufficient conditions for the vanishing of certain topological obstructions in the complement. This simple object, the complement of a collection of (n-1)- dimensional linear subspaces in n-dimensional space, displays a surprisingly rich structure. The variety of methods which have been found useful for analyzing it come from combinatorics, differential equations, and K-theory.\n",
      "a9004205 EAR $45000 I propose to develop a geochronometer of platinum-rick minerals based on the decay of 190Pt to 186Os. Despite the long half-life (600 b.y.) and low parent isotope abundance (0.013%), I have established in preliminary work that sperrylite (PtAs2) has very large Pt/ZOs ratios, and should generate easily measurable quantities of radiogenic 186Os. I will develop a suitable chemistry for Os separation, and determine parent/daughter isotope ratios using isotope dilution/ion microprobe analysis. The half-life of 190Pt will be precisely determined using natural sperrylites of well documented age. Other Pt-rich minerals will be surveyed for possible use with this decay scheme, and a variety of Pt ore deposits will be dated to test the applicability of the Pt-Os geochronometer.\n",
      "a9004206 EAR $78890 Recently it has become clear from a variety of field observations that downstream size decrease in aggrading river systems is caused in large part by selective deposition of coarse clasts. However, sorting by selective deposition has never been studied systematically under controlled conditions. The absence of a set of reference data on downstream sorting is even more striking in light of the number of theories that have been advanced recently to explain it. The main goal of the proposed project is to carry out a series of basic experiments on selective transport and deposition in poorly sorted gravelly sediments. Most of the experiments will be conducted in a large channel at the St. Anthony Falls Hydraulic Laboratory. There we will produce deposits from a poorly sorted sand-gravel mix over a distance of about 50 m. The main variables will be rate of sediment feed (and hence deposition), and channel form (straight, weakly sinuous, braided). In addition we will make detailed measurements of sediment transport and surface texture in a smaller flume at Johns Hopkins University. These data will be used to develop surface-based transport formulas that will be used in modeling the sorting observed in the large flume.\n",

      "a9004213 CTS $175479 Interest in convection heat transfer from arrays of discrete heat sources has been stimulated by rapid advancements in VLSI chip technologies and the attendant need for effective heat dissipation. Recently, it has become clear that an important cooling option involves direct immersion of electronic components in a dielectric liquid, and considerable effort is being directed towards use of this option to dissipate large heat fluxes (> 100 W/cm2). Such efforts typically involve single-phase forced convection and forced convection boiling, with measures for effecting heat transfer enhancement. However, it is believed that, in the quest for achieving larger levels dissipation with forced convection, insufficient attention is being given to moderate heat flux applications for which cooling with no imposed flow of the dielectric liquid is desirable, if not mandatory. Such cooling schemes, involving either single-or two-phase thermosyphons, offer benign, passive conditions for which pumping requirements are eliminated, thereby reducing mechanical problems related to the hydrodynamic loads and vibrations induced by high speed flows. High-powered desktop computers and workstations of the future would constitute an important application of this technology, since complex coolant distribution units cannot be used in such situations. The proposed study seeks to assess means by which non boiling and boiling heat transfer from arrays of discrete sources may be enhanced for free convection in a cavity. For heat sources with and without extended surfaces, experiments and numerical simulations will be used to establish a basic understanding of related flow and thermal conditions and to determine operating conditions which maximize heat transfer per unit package volume. Heat transfer enhancement schemes to be considered include, but are not restricted to, low-profile studs, pin-fin arrays, longitudinal fin arrays, and porous fin arrays. Three-dimensional models, including the conjugate problem of substrate conduction, will be used for comparison with experimental results. The work is expected to enhance understanding of basic flow and heat transfer associated with discrete sources in a dielectric liquid with particular attention to heat transfer enhancement schemes which maximize heat flux at low coolant volumetric flow rate and low coolant system volume.\n",

      "a9004218 EAR $45000 The PIs have developed and tested a method whereby the mean etchable fission track (FT) lengths parallel and perpendicular to the crystallographic c-axis in apatite may be precisely determined. The lengths so determined differ for a single population of FTs (parallel tracks > perpendicular) but, because of their equivalent thermal histories, they are defined as \"equivalent lengths\". The PIs plane to use this new method to determine whether the physical process of FT annealing in apatite varies with crystallographic orientation or whether we are observing experimental artifacts due to anisotropic etching. Similarly, they will determine whether the FT annealing process varies with crystal chemistry (e.g. Cl-rich track lengths> F- rich) or whether this is also an etching phenomenon. The method proposed, in order to address these questions and to better calibrate this important thermochronometer, is a series of isochronal laboratory annealing experiments (ranging from O.3- 1OOOO hours and 23-400oC). Specifically, they will investigate: 1) the correlation of observed FT length anisotropy with etching anisotropy in apatite, 2) the variation of mean etchable FT length with time, temperature and crystallographic orientation for a range of apatite compositions ;(F-, Cl-, OH-, and Mn-rich) at low temperature (23oC) and elevated temperatures, 3) how activation energy for FT annealing varies a) with mean FT length at fixed orientation, b) between equivalent lengths, and c) with host crystal chemistry, 4) the relationship of the above results with currently published results (Galbraith and Laslett, 1988) relating the dependence of FT density (tracks/unit area) to the mean etchable FT length. These new data will then be used to derive a mathematical expression relating the \"equivalent length\" to the time- temperature (t-T) history of the apatite. This new expression should result in a significant improvement in estimates of t-T paths experienced by geologic samples.\n",
      "a9004219 EAR $87175 The Sao Francisco craton region, one of two cratonic areas in Brazil initially formed in the Archean as part of a much larger crustal block. Subsequent tectonic activity has reduced the area to a relatively small remnant. In the southern Sao Francisco region of Minas Gerais, Brazil a relatively complete and reasonably exposed record of Proterozoic activity exists. This project will, with the close cooperation of geologists from the Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto, assemble detailed transects across this margin and conduct radiometric age determinations in an attempt to identify the tectonic style and ages of the precambrian tectonic events affecting the Sao Francisco craton of eastern Brazil.\n",
      "a9004220 EAR $207665 This research is to study the detailed P- and S-wave velocity crust and upper mantle structures under Tibet along a nearly N-S profile across the Plateau. In cooperation with the Institute of Geophysics, State Seismological Bureau of the Peoples' Republic of China, the deployment of 10 or more PASSCAL seismic systems for 12 months will be done recording teleseisms, regional events in central and eastern Asia, and local seismicity in the Tibetan Plateau. The Tibetan Plateau is a first order topographic feature on Earth; it represents an \"end member\" in the global tectonics in terms of the intensity of collisional tectonics. This cooperative research program between the U.S. and Chinese scientists will involve equal sharing of funding and data. This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.\n",
      "a9004221 INT $3260 This award will support study of the Japanese language by an American scientist or engineer by providing a stipend, tuition, or other course-related expenses. The objectives of the program are to enable active U.S. scientists and engineers to acquire sufficient familiarity with the language and customs of Japan to allow them to function independently there; or to acquire sufficient expertise in reading Japanese to be able to understand technical abstracts in their field of interest. There is a critical need for more effective technical communication between American and Japanese researchers. This award is intended to help remove language and cultural barriers to U.S.-Japanese cooperative research and to facilitate science and technology exchange.\n",

Several investigators will participate in a long-term measurement and analysis project, including the deployment of expendable temperature (XBT) and conductivity-temperature-depth (XCTD) probes from ships transiting the Pacific. High resolution sampling and frequent repeats will provide data for the space-time analysis of the upper ocean circulation.\n",
      "a9004232 EAR $51203 Four aspects of the biology of Recent stalked crinoids in the Straits of Florida are examined as they contribute to understanding paleoecological processes: 1) niche partitioning of habitat and food among four species distributed as three sympatric pairs--does it support or refute tiering, hydrodynamic and food partitioning hypotheses proposed for fossil taxa. Measured variables include current velocity, stalk height, crown diameter, filter density, gut contents and available food; 2) larval recruitment contributions to aggregated versus scattered populations; contributions of recruitment and relocation of vagile adults in re-establishing aggregations following physical disturbance; 3) relationship between possible behavioral patterns (feeding, activity or locomotory patterns or cycles) and variations in current regime and 4) skeletal contributions of Recent crinoids to sediment as an analogue for depositional processes in ancient crinoidal sediments--analyses of post-mortem processes and potential preservational biases. Work will be conducted via submersible, time-lapse cinematography, morphological, photographic and sedimentological analyses of collected material. Isocrininds represent major components of macroepibenthic assemblages in the study area and have a fossil record dating to the Triassic. As such, they represent an excellent analogue for paleoecological processes.\n",

The primary sponsors are the National Science Foundation, The Office of Naval Research, and IEEE Washington Section-Electron Device Group. This conference will bring together distinguished American and foreign researchers in the growth, characterization, and fabrication of crystalline and amorphous SIC devices and related materials.

      "a9004238 ECS $258000 All plasmas are subject to a variety of instabilities, irrespective of the type of devices in which these are produced and their intended applications. These include plasma sources for neutral, electron and ion beams, any type of arc discharge, plasma etching devices for solid state processing, basic experimental devices, geophysical and astrophysical plasma and fusion machines. The deleterious consequences of the instabilities are many: non-uniformities in plasma, increased transport and, if violent enough, a macroscopic break up. These can lead minimally to degradation of the performance of the device or system and sometimes to its break down. Therefore the elimination of these instabilities is always desirable and sometimes imperative. This project continues research into active feedback control of plasma instabilities. Specifically, a new remote suppressor using a small ion beam will be used, which will have minimal perturbation to the system. Robust controllers will also be studied. Applications of these controllers to industrial plasma devices will be explored. Two faculty members and one graduate student will carry out the proposed research using the facilities of the Columbia University Plasma Research Laboratory. The experimental work will utilize the redesigned Columbia Linear Machine.\n",
      "a9004241 EAR $44322 The Cordillera Darwin complex in southern Chile exposes high grade metamorphic rocks in close proximity to rocks of considerably lower grade across the Beagle Canal. Recent models suggest that the high grade rocks form the core of an extensional \"metamorphic core complex\" and their exposure was accommodated by large-scale tectonic denudation. This project is a continuation of a petrographic and age dating effort to test this model by assembly of PTt paths and radiometric dating techniques. Data collected so far are consistent with the proposed structural models, but are not sufficiently robust or abundant to unambiguously constrain them. The purpose of this renewal is to document additional PT paths from both high and low grade localities and to collect age data to constrain particularly the early cooling history. Results are expected to place tight constraints on the pressure (depth), temperature and time evolution of this area that will allow a thorough test of the extensional core complex theory.\n",
      "a9004242 DEB $25000 In this study, Dr. Michael Arnold and his colleagues will analyze natural hybridization between the Louisiana iris species, I.fulva and I.hexagona. The genetic interaction between these two species has been used as the classic example of the process of interspecific gene flow. In order to study the pattern of transfer of genetic material between these two species, the investigators have established an experimental hybrid population in southern Louisiana. Individuals of I. hexagona were introduced into a natural population of I. Fulva and were allowed to flower during the spring of 1990. Leaf material and seeds have been collected from each of the flowering individuals of both species. Genetic markers that are diagnostic for either I. fulva or I. hexagona will be examined using material isolated form the leaf and seed samples. This will allow a test to determine whether or not hybrids have been formed and whether hybridization occurs bi-directionally (ie., with I. fulva and I. hexagona acting both maternal and paternal parents). These data will allow an estimate of the effects of natural selection on hybridization between these two species by comparing the proportion of interspecific versus intraspecific offspring that are produced.\n",
      "a9004245 IBN $50000 Previous research in this laboratory has shown that the fish gill, like the mammalian lung, has the unique ability to regulate the concentration of a variety of hormones in blood through specific activation and inactivation processes. All blood pumped by the fish heart must first pass through the gills before it is distributed to the rest of the body. Thus the gill is in an ideal location to effectively serve as a biological blood filter, and indeed, the PI has shown that the efficiency of hormone metabolism by the gill may exceed 90%. The proposed research will examine the mechanisms through which the gill metabolizes several important blood pressure regulating hormones, catecholamines, angiotensin and atrial natriuretic peptide. Preliminary studies have also shown that these same mechanisms may be involved in degradation of toxic substances and these studies will be continued. This project is significant for several reasons: 1. Information derived from these studies will further our understanding of endocrine control systems in lower vertebrates. 2. Due to the similarity between gills and lungs the present work will provide insight into the evolution of the lung as a metabolic organ and the mechanisms of pulmonary metabolism. These studies also illustrate the potential of the gill as an alternative, non-mammalian model in biomedical research. 3. Evaluation of the gill as an organ for detoxification has not been critically examined. Our preliminary work indicates that the gill may also be an important tool in environmental studies.\n",
      "a9004251 DMS $15466 This work will focus on mathematical problems arising in the theory of quasiconformal maps and harmonic analysis. Quasiconformal maps are smooth univalent transformations of planar (or higher dimensional) domains in which the distortion - called the dilatation - is controlled. Such maps occur as solutions of a partial differential equation called the Beltrami equation. One goal of the research will be to find new characterizations for quasiconformality in terms of oscillation functions, maximal functions and doubling measures. These are concepts taken from other parts of mathematical analysis in which certain analytic hypotheses are usually assumed. Part of this effort will be to consider how the geometry of quasiconformal maps can be used to reduce the requirements of analyticity. A second line of investigation will continue research on the problem of describing domains which can be the image of a disk under a quasiconformal transformation. Such domains, quasidisks, cannot be arbitrary. Their boundaries cannot have cusps, for instance. Insight into the structure of quasidisks, will provide important information into the nature of any image domain under quasiconformal mapping.\n",
      "a9004252 EAR $87827 This research has two primary goals: 1. to compare rigorously eight different techniques used for determining the exposure-ages of geomorphic surfaces; 2. to understand the timing of alluvial fan aggradation on the bajada below the eastern Sierra Nevada. During the first year of the project, cores will be collected from boulders on a chronologic sequence of five geomorphic surfaces for which exposure-ages are constrained by previous geologic investigation. For each boulder and surface, model exposure-ages will be calculated from the measured accumulation of different cosmogenic isotopes produced in situ including 3He, 10Be, 36Cl, and in some cases 26Al and 14C. After comparing the ages obtained from isotopic methods with existing ages estimates, varnish cation-ratio and radiocarbon ages, and 10Be accumulation in soils, the most appropriate system(s) for determining the temporal and spatial distribution of alluvial fan aggradation will be chosen, also, there will be an intensive study of two drainages in the eastern Sierra Nevada, one glaciated, the other unglaciated. To determine if glaciation and fan aggradation were synchronous, the abundance of cosmogenic isotopes and calculate model exposure-ages for samples taken from boulders on fan surfaces and glacial moraines will be obtained. Age-data gathered in the second year of this study will provide a direct and important link between the marine isotope and terrestrial records of climate change. Because of the inter-disciplinary project team and because this investigation is part of a larger, coordinated University of Washington effort to understand the genesis, chronology, and response to climate change of Sierra Nevada alluvial fans, this project represents a unique opportunity for advancement in the fields of geomorphology and Quaternary geochronology.\n",
      "a9004253 DMS $222067 This project involves research in ergodic theory. Ergodic theory in general concerns understanding the average behavior of systems whose dynamics is too complicated or chaotic to be followed in microscopic detail. The particular work to be undertaken by Professors Lind and Tuncel is in the area of \"symbolic dynamics\". A symbolic dynamical system is a collection of two-way infinite strings of symbols from a finite alphabet. These strings satisfy a formation rule which specifies which symbols are allowed to follow which as one moves along the string. Symbolic dynamical systems have recently found widespread application in the modelling of data transmission. Some of the particular areas of investigation will involve the dynamics of commuting automorphisms of compact groups, the construction of Markov partitions using self-similar tilings of the plane, and codings and invariants of Markov chains. The work stresses interactions between the fields of ergodic theory, algebra, and geometry.\n",
      "a9004260 EAR $344900 This award is for support of a research program to use nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy in conjunction with other analytical techniques to investigate four important issues of mineralogical and geochemical interest. These issues are: 1) the behavior of important, rock-forming minerals undergoing structural phase transitions, 2) the structural environments of hydrogen-containing species in aluminosilicate glasses and the mechanisms of diffusion of these species in these glasses, 3) cation order/disorder in some phases stable at high pressure that may be important minerals in the earth's mantle, and 4) the structural environments and dynamic behavior of cations adsorbed on clay minerals. The work will be carried out by the P.I. and his associated at the University of Illinois.\n",
      "a9004270 EAR $22225 During development of collisional orogens high pressure-low temperature metamorphism commonly forms during the subduction phase, but is often obscured by post-tectonic thermal equilibration or by later deformation and mineral growth. The metamorphic core of the Brooks range exposes regional high pressure-low temperature rocks adjacent to lower grade fold and thrust belt rocks. This project will map structures across this structural/metamorphic boundary, conduct thermobarometry on collected samples and perform radiometric age determination. Results will be used to characterize the metamorphic and structural conditions during orogenesis and to determine the uplift history of these high pressure/low temperature rocks.\n",
      "a9004277 EAR $99942 In the evolution of mountain belts, major episodes of tectonism are often recorded by the development of rocks of the mylonite series. The relationship of deformation and associated chemical changes, at the mineral and whole rock scales, to radiometric ages is the objective of this research. The size of mineral and isotopic equilibrium domains developed during mylonitization of mafic rocks and the response of zircon and titanite will be investigated. Results will lead to applying concepts of domainal equilibrium on measuring absolute ages of selected faults in the Southern Appalachians and their geodynamic implications for the accretionary history of the Appalachian Mountain belt.\n",
      "a9004278 DEB $40381 These experiments will examine the evolutionary dynamics of genetically variable Bacillus subtilis populations in soil microcosms and examine the biological and physical factors which facilitate recombination. The experiments will be performed during a sabbatical leave in the laboratory of Dr.C.A. Istock at the University of Arizona. These questions will be addressed: 1) Do natural genotypes of B. subtilis differ in fitness? 2) Do relative fitnesses of genotypes change as a function of biotic or physical environmental conditions? 3) Is recombination frequency correlated with specific habitat conditions? 4) Are genetically variable soil populations of B. subtilis more resistant to bacteriophage predators than are monomorphic cultures? 5) Is there a genetic cost to sexual reproduction in B. subtilis? The basic procedure in these experiments will be to 1) inoculate soil microcosms with heat-shock spores or vegetative cells of one or more isogenic strains of B. subtilis, 2) sample these populations at intervals, 3) estimate the density of vegetative cells and spores, and 4) determine genotype/recombination frequencies by protein, antibiotic resistance, colony morph, and DNA restriction fragment polymorphisms. Additionally, to address question 5 the PI will transform competent B. subtilis in broth culture using prepared donor DNA. These results will illuminate the relative costs, benefits, and ecological and evolutionary consequences of genetic recombination and diversity in a species with a primitively asexual breeding system.\n",
      "a9004281 DEB $59475 Senescence of whole plants and of plant organs os moderately well understood physiologically. The PI will begin a nine-month program away from the home institution with a three- month internship at a leading center for physiological and ecological research (Carnegie Institute of Washington and Stanford University\"s Department of Biological Sciences), learning senescence physiology, measuring nitrogen movement within and out of senescing plants, and investigating the consequences of two kinds of experimentally induced leaf senescence on plant productivity. The short-term productivity measurements will expose the PI to current techniques for measuring light, photosynthesis, and respiration. Next, the PI will spend six months at a field station in Costa Rica, where the Pi will use the knowledge and techniques acquired at Carnegie to conduct field experiments. The target organisms will be evergreen perennial, a group of plants that is crucial to the design of sustainable agricultural systems and to the understanding of tropical forest dynamics. If successful, this research will enable scientists to accelerate or delay plant senescence by manipulating light and soul nutrients.\n",
      "a9004284 DEB $42638 The primary purpose of the sabbatical is to allow the principal investigator to collaborate with Dr. Stuart Barker (University of New England, Armidale, Australia) on an ecological genetic analysis of cuticular permeability and epicuticular hydrocarbon composition in Australian populations of the cactiphilic fly, Drosophila buzzatii. Within and among population genetic variation for the two traits--and for their plastic response to variation in ambient temperature and humidity regimes--will be quantified using a half-sib experimental design. This analysis will repeated three times--during the annual summer population bottleneck, during recovery from the bottleneck, and when population sizes are maximal--to assess possible temporal changed in G-matrices. Mate choice experiments will assess the role of epicuticular hydrocarbons in the mating system of D. buzzatii. Ancillary experiments will quantify the impact of dehydration on reproductive performance of D. buzzatii. The sabbatical with Dr. Barker will provide the principal investigator with conceptual background and genetic techniques required to conduct his own program of research into the evolution of physiological adaptations and acclimation responses to environmental variation. A second project--field and laboratory studies o australian cicada thermobiology--will augment the principal investigator's work with U.S. species and lead to phylogenetic analysis of patterns of body temperature regulation in cicadas.\n",
      "a9004287 DEB $64463 Disease-producing and parasitic species are important agents of natural selection in the evolution of their hosts. Disease-producing species are often bacteria or fungi; parasites are often insects or other invertebrates. Each of these classes of organisms has a different physiology, and therefore can present a different challenge to a host. Ford and Haldane postulated that this diversity of challenges produces a diversity of selective pressures which help explain the high genetic diversity observed in human populations. The PI plans to test the generality of this hypothesis by using a woody perennial plant, the wild thyme (Thymus vulgaris L.) and three species that parasitize it or feed upon it. These include the mollusk Agriolimax reticulatus Muller, the lepidopteran Pyrausta sanguinalis L., and the mildew fungus Oidium sp. Thyme plants can be characterized by their terpene composition, and single plants contain a single terpene. The biochemical pathways of terpene production are known, and the genetic control of terpene production involves single Mendelian loci. Thyme populations are highly polymorphic for these terpene chemotypes. The PI proposes to (1) study the differential sensitivity of these terpene variants to parasites and (2) document the diversity of selective pressures generated.\n",

Washington State University is committed to providing the remaining funds needed. The instrument's analytical capabilities for trace element and isotopic analysis are well-suited to the study of various rock types as well as groundwater quality problems. Housed in the Geoanalytical Laboratory at Washington State, the facility will be used by a wide range of research projects in these areas of the earth sciences and will serve as a regional resource for northwest scientists from a number of research institutions.\n",

      "a9004300 EAR $47000 Conodonts have been utilized, especially during the last 50 years, as principal biologic indices of geologic age. Paleoecologic interpretations of observed distributions have been attributed largely to life habits of conodont animals, and only general mention has been made of the potential for post-mortem disruption of death assemblages. The effects of post-mortem transport processes on distributions of conodont elements in shallow-marine carbonate environments will be investigated by means of laboratory settling and flume experiments. Because of the highly variable sizes and shapes of these phosphatic grains, significant differences exist in terminal settling velocity in a static fluid and are suggested for (1) critical conditions (mean flow velocity) for initiation of movement, (2) transport within migrating small bedforms, (3) differential sorting of elements along a transport path, and (4) amount of breakage during fluid transport. These hydrodynamic differences are extremely important because they would have strongly influenced the distribution of discrete conodont elements, particularly in moderate to high energy regimes. Quantification of these factors can then be used to constrain the paleoecologic interpretation of preserved assemblages of conodonts in peritidal carbonate rocks. This will permit a quantitative approach to determining the amount of post-mortem transport experienced by conodont elements prior to their burial and will also allow for direct statistical comparison of the composition of different samples, when taphonomic effects are factored. Quantification of post-mortem transport broadly enhances the interpretation of biostratigraphic and paleoenvironmental data of conodonts, with implications for the study of other skeletal allochems, by providing models for the interpretation of physical environmental processes that played a major role in the formation of fossiliferous deposits.\n",
      "a9004302 EAR $103370 Garnet is a common metamorphic mineral in many medium and high-grade terranes. This project will explore the possibility that U, Pb, Nd and Sm are sufficiently immobile in garnet that if an age progression from core to rim of garnets can be observed, it may be equated to growth during active prograde metamorphism. If successful, garnet growth age information can be combined with geothermometry to follow the rate of temperature change during metamorphism. The project will evaluate the blocking temperatures for the diffusion of U, Pb, Nd and Sm in calcic and iron-rich garnets, and will examine zoned garnets from two well- studied areas of high grade metamorphism - the Grenville of Ontario and New York and the Archean Pikwitonei Domain of Manitoba. Results, if successful will provide a method to determine heating rates in high temperature metamorphism, a parameter that has considerable importance in orogenic studies but can not be measured or satisfactorily estimated at present.\n",
      "a9004303 EAR $47539 Field mapping studies will be used to evaluate and apply the critical wedge model of thrust sheet mechanics in an attempt to resolve existing conflicts between thrust sequences predicted by the model and those suggested by geological evidence. According to the critical wedge model, the advance of the thrust belt under the force of horizontal compression, requires that the wedge deform internally to attain and maintain a critical taper angle. Potential taper-building mechanisms are: out-of-sequence thrusting; duplex formation; and synchronous thrusting. Field work began in 1988 and 1989 in the Sawtooth Range of the northwest Montana thrust belt during a previous award entitled \"Sequence of Thrusting: Implications for Mechanical Models of Thrust Belts\". Existing geological maps proved to be inaccurate or inadequate for the purpose of detailed structural analysis and the area had to be remapped. Two additional field seasons will be required to completed the mapping phase. The construction of regional cross-sections, sequential restoration of the sections, and forward modelling, will answer two principal questions: (1) which of the taper-building mechanisms were operative? and (2) have they occurred in sufficient magnitude to have allowed the critical wedge model to function?\n",
      "a9004305 EAR $15000 This award provides one-half the funds required to purchase a cathodoluminescence (CL) spectrometer system that will be housed and operated in the Department of Geology at St. Lawrence University. The University is committed to providing the remaining funds. The cathodoluminescent properties of minerals (the ability to emit visible light when bombarded with electrons) depends on a variety of factors such a crystalline defects and chemical impurities. For the mineral quartz, it is found that its CL spectra can be used to fingerprint quartz grains from different source rocks. Hence, the CL spectra of quartz grains in sedimentary rocks holds promise as a tool for reconstructing the provenance of sediments in ancient sedimentary basins. The equipment purchased with this award will be used by the PI to further investigate the applicability of CL in such studies.\n",
      "a9004310 IBN $160000 The two major aspects of germ cell development examined in this proposal are: a) oogenesis per se (the transformation of oogonia into oocytes) and early oocyte development and b) the initiation of vitellogenesis. Both the pipefish, Syngnathus scovelli, and the seahorse, Hippocampus erectus, will be used because of the unique arrangement of developing follicles in their ovaries, where a sequential pattern of oocyte development is observed. This pattern begins on one side of the ovary and a gradient of follicles of increasing developmental age extends to the opposite side. Little is known about the regulation of early events of oocyte formation in embryonic ovaries of most vertebrates and the absence of very early stage oocytes in adult ovaries in many species. The presence of germinal tissue (oogonia and meiotic oocytes) in a restricted but easily accessible region of syngnathan ovaries makes these teleost ideal for studying early germ cell events and their hormonal regulation in an adult vertebrate. The extent of oogonial proliferation and the time for progression of oocytes through meiosis will be determined in vivo. Dr. Selman will then attempt to duplicate both processes in vitro by examining the influence of various hormones and co- cultured tissues on oogonial division and the progression of oocytes from leptotene up to diplotene stages. The process of follicle formation will also be examined. Dr. Selman intends to characterize the transition from previtellogenesis to vitellogenesis in syngnathans and will address the cellular mechanism(s) responsible for the initiation of vitellogenesis. For this she will examine follicular vascularization, vitellogenin accessibility, the ontogeny of functional vitellogenin rectors and the intraoocytic fate of internalized vitellogenin. Studies will be performed both in vivo and in vitro to determine whether a cessation of normal lysosomal synthesis and/or activity or a modification of the endocytic pathway distinguishes previtellogenic form vitellogenic oocytes.\n",
      "a9004312 EAR $85000 The goal of this research program is to discover the details of the sulfide mineral oxidation reaction mechanism. A series of measurements of oxidation rates for several different sulfide minerals, show different reaction orders for different minerals as well as two distinct ranges of activation energies. These differences are presumably caused by differences in the overall reaction mechanism. The P.I. have used thermodynamic and kinetic information on individual aqueous sulfur species and elementary reactions taken from the literature to construct a general model of the sulfide mineral oxidation reaction mechanism. They propose to refine this model using experimental data, gathered as part of this research, on the effects of various catalysts and inhibitors (chemical probes of the mechanism) on the rate of the overall reaction and on the distribution of sulfur species in the reacted solution. These data will eventually be woven into a quantitative numerical model that should prove useful in a wide range of scientific and technological endeavors.\n",
      "a9004315 EAR $63067 Continent-continent collisions commonly produce high topography with rapid uplift rates and accompanying high erosion rates, however these important tectonic parameters are difficult to quantify. This project will utilize fission-track technology to constrain uplift rates in the still-active Northwestern Himalaya.

      "a9004325 DMR $40000 A series of X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (XAFS) experiments is proposed, to measure the local structure about substituted atoms in high-Tc superconductors.

In addition, they propose preliminary experiments on single crystal or oriented films and substituted- materials using the high polarization of synchrotron radiation to enhance the amplitude of the XAFS signal for particular bond directions.\n",
      "a9004331 MCB $219237 Stomata are biological valves in the aerial organs of plants that regulate simultaneously photosynthesis and transpiration. The opening and closing of stomata are affected by the shrinking or swelling of \"guard cells\" which form their edges. The chloroplasts of the guard cells that surround the stomatal pore do not senesce (yellow) at the same time as those in mesophyll tissue of the same leaf. The long range goal of the project is to culture stomatal guard cells in ways that preserve their unique physiological properties, including the functionality of their chloroplasts. Such cultures could be used to study the induction and regulation of chloroplast senescence. This laboratory has established protoplasts of stomatal guard cells of Nicotiana glauca in culture. However, optimal conditions for cell survival have not yet been identified. A variety of culture conditions will be evaluated to identify those that are optimal for cell survival. To determine whether any of the unique properties of guard cells are maintained in culture, some of the physiological and biochemical properties of freshly isolated guard cell protoplasts will be compared to those of protoplasts of cultured cells. The same experiments will be performed with guard cell protoplasts from senescing (chlorotic) leaves: 1) to evaluate their viability relative to those of guard cells of non-senescing leaves, and 2) to determine whether there are any differences in the properties of guard cells of the two types of leaves that might explain why the stomata of senescing leaves fail to open in response to light. This research is directed at developing techniques for culturing stomatal guard cells from leaves under conditions that not only permit their survival but also maintain their differentiated properties. The availability of such cultured cells would greatly facilitate further research on the physiological function of these cells which regulate the passage of water and gases across the surfaces of leaves. Since the chlorophyll-containing organelles, chloroplasts, of guard cells behave differently from the chloroplasts of other cells under some physiological conditions, these cells would provide an excellent model system in which to study the regulation of the functional state of chloroplasts. Since this research will be conducted at an undergraduate institution it will also provide an excellent opportunity for undergraduate students to gain first hand experience in research in plant cell biology.\n",
      "a9004332 IBN $231000 Reproduction of fish, as in other vertebrates, is controlled by the brain through the endocrine system. The pituitary gland plays a major role in initiating reproductive maturation (puberty), maintaining production of sperm and eggs by the gonads, and inducing final maturation and gamete release (spawning). In tetrapod vertebrates, two pituitary hormones regulate reproduction; follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which stimulates early stages of gametogenesis, and luteinizing hormone, which induces ovulation and corpus luteum formation in the female, for example. Until recently, it was generally believed that the pituitary gland of fish produced only one hormone that controlled all aspects of reproduction. It is now established that in salmon there are two pituitary hormones, gonadotropin I and gonadotropin II, that may control reproduction. The proposed research will study the functions of these two gonadotropins in salmon. The study will also address when the two gonadotropins first appear in the pituitary gland and blood, and how the brain controls their synthesis and release. This work is significant in that it should advance our knowledge of how salmon reproduction is controlled. Since it is well-established that reproduction in tetrapod vertebrates is controlled by two pituitary hormones, comparison of fish can be made with mammals, birds, amphibians and reptiles. This information should give us a better perspective on vertebrate reproduction in general. Futhermore, a better understanding of the control of fish reproduction will allow the rational development of techniques to manage reproduction of captive broodstock in fish aquaculture.\n",
      "a9004333 CHE $346560 The goal of this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program is the development of new methods for stereoselective synthesis of organic compounds based on compounds containing such transition metals as tungsten and molybdenum. Such methods are extremely important because the three-dimensional structure of a molecule can affect profoundly its chemical and biological properties. The two aims of the project are the development of new methods using metal complexes for asymmetric and regioselective syntheses and the elucidation of the mechanisms of stereoselective reactions which are synthetically useful. The potential utility of higher oxidation state organometallic complexes for these applications will be explored also. A new method will be developed for obtaining detailed structural information for organometallic compounds in solution. Ligands containing paramagnetic metal ions which bind to organometallics will be designed and synthesized. NMR measurements using these new shift reagents will allow detailed delineation of structure (angles and distances) of reactive organometallic species, especially catalytic intermediates, which exist only in solution.\n",

      "a9004339 EAR $113812 The Mojave desert between the San Andreas and the Garlock fault zones occupies a key position in Southwestern U.S. tectonics. Recent results indicate that a previously unrecognized region of early Miocene-age rifting is present which has led to the discovery of Mesozoic tectonometamorphic events as well as to an improved understanding of present strike-slip faulting in the region and its role in accommodating Pacific- North American plate motion. This renewal will focus on the structure, timing relations, shear zone petrology and uplift history of the extensional complex, and will document the depositional history of syn-and post-tectonic sedimentary rocks in basins adjacent to the core complex. The timing and conditions of formation of the Mesozoic high-grade metamorphic rocks exhumed by Miocene detachments will also be addressed. Results will be applied to the Mesozoic and Cenozoic tectonic and paleogeographic evolution of the western United States.\n",
      "a9004346 CCR $61317 Petri nets are widely used for modeling and analysis of concurrent processing systems. In l985, Suzuki introduced a new class of Petri nets, called the temporal Petri nets, in which certain restrictions on the firings of transitions are represented by formulas containing temporal operators and showed that they are quite useful in specifying and proving fundamental properties of concurrent systems such as eventuality and fairness. The goal of the research is to further investigate the potential of temporal Petri nets and develop new analysis and synthesis methods of concurrent systems based on them.\n",
      "a9004350 EAR $180098 This research is to carry out tree-ring studies that have been proven to yield information, absolute year dates and zones of rupture, for prehistoric earthquakes. The testing does not damage the trees. Paleoseismology is essential for establishing a long enough record of earthquakes to enable estimation of probabilities for future major earthquakes. The immediate future is likely to be similar to the most recent past. Coastal redwood trees or well-preserved stumps exist along several faults in northern California and some ages extend back over 600 years. The research will concentrate on two main project areas, the San Andreas fault north of San Francisco and the Little Salmon Creek fault zone at the southern end of the Cascadia Subduction Zone. This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.\n",
      "a9004353 IBN $255000 The long term objective of this research is to understand the molecular and cellular processes by which ethylene controls fruit ripening and gene expression. The model system is Lycopersicon esculentum (tomato). By analyzing the effect of promoter deletions on gene expression in fruit from transformed plants, and in a recently developed microprojectile transient assay system, 5'-flanking regions that control gene expression in a positive and negative manner have been identified. Sites that react with developmentally regulated DNA-binding activities have been delineated, and a clone encoding a DNA-binding protein has been isolated. The specific goal is to elucidate the mechanisms of ethylene action at the gene level. Ethylene-inducible promoter fine structure will be analyzed by determining the effect of promoter mutations on gene expression in a transient gene expression system and in transgenic fruit. Specific mutations will include deletion of sites that react with DNA binding proteins, and alterations of binding site position and orientation within the promoter. Factors that regulate ethylene inducible gene expression will be studied by cloning DNA binding proteins that bind to critical DNA regulatory sequences. The cloned gene will be used to generate specific antibodies and these tools will be used to determine the mechanism that regulates DNA binding activity. DNA binding protein function will be elucidated genetically by analyzing the phenotype of transgenic plants with reduced levels of DNA binding activity due to the expression of an antisense DNA binding protein gene. The interaction of the DNA binding protein with ethylene and/or other nuclear proteins will be analyzed. %%% The plant hormone, ethylene, controls fruit ripening. This project is an investigation, at the molecular and genetic level, of how that control is carried out.\n",
      "a9004354 EAR $71137 There are two competing models for the mesozoic tectonic history of southern California - closure of a marginal basin between North America and an outboard continental fragment and normal oceanic subduction under North America. The Pelona- Orocopia-Rand-Portal Ridge schists and the Vincent-Chocolate Mountains-Orocopia- Rand thrust faults are products of this tectonic episode. This study will attempt to resolve this issue by close examination of the thrust fault in the Gavilan Hills where the clear-cut northeast vergence forms the main argument for the marginal basin model. The work will test the possibility that the northeast motion is due to a younger normal fault which re-activated the original thrust. Results are applicable to the resolution of Mesozoic tectonics in the southwestern United States.\n",
      "a9004355 ANI $280910 The research performed under this award will include performance evaluation and design for communication networks of the future, particularly large, high-speed optical networks. The main topics are 1) improved bounds and approximations for circuit-switched networks, 2) dynamic local routing strategies, 3) massively parallel switching algorithms, 4) optical interconnection patterns, and 5) computation with unreliable components. The approach includes modeling, analysis, and design. The models will be based on current and anticipated future technology and will cover the spectrum of networks from circuit-switched to datagram packet networks. Analysis will consist of a mixture of exact probabilistic methods and simulation. Design will be motivated by modeling and analysis and aided by optimization tools of both combinatorial and nonlinear iterative types. Inequalities from information theory, mathematical physics, decision theory, and combinatorics will be applied to yield new performance bounds, providing a bridge between design and performance evaluation.\n",
      "a9004357 CCR $179463 Logic programming is usually taken to be synonymous with relational programming. Two important criteria for a broader logic programming language are its ability to avoid extra-logical features, such as cut, assert, retract, etc., and its amenability to efficient compilation. The broader basis consists of three logical forms: equations, relations, and subset assertions, along with an accompanying set of matching and unification operations. Equations provide the ability to define deterministic operations without Prolog's cut. Subset assertions can be used to define more declaratively Prolog's setof as well as transitive-closure operations, both of which are traditionally expressed using assert and retract. To demonstrate that this broader framework is practical, further studies will be made in (1) better integrating the three logical forms, (2) developing an efficient implementation, (3) carrying out substantial applications, and (4) examining useful extensions and variations.\n",
      "a9004368 EAR $72000 This project is to investigate the origins and tectonic significance of intermediate composition flood eruptives that re associated with continental rifts. Chemical and radiometric isotopic analyses of approximately 10 natural flood phonolite and trachyte lavas will be used to constrain possible source reservoir(s) and the evolution of these lavas. Melting experiments on samples from this suite will be used to examine the processes and the P, T. and composition conditions necessary for the genesis of these lavas. Possible source mineralogies, polybaric and polythermal crystallization sequences, and the role of volatiles in partial melting and mass transport will be identified. Complementary studies of compositionally simplified analog systems will facilitate interpretation of phase relations and extrapolation of results to different magma compositions. Forward approach studies, if appropriate, will test petrogenetic models that result from the inverse experiments. The result of this integrated experimental and analytical approach are relevant to understanding heat and mass transfer from mantle to crust during rifting, identifying the involvement of crust in rift magmatism, and developing geophysical models for rift evolution and structure.\n",
      "a9004373 CTS $45394 Under a Small Grant for Exploratory Research, an investigation is to be carried out which explores the range of validity and underlying theoretical basis of a newly developed boundary condition for application to computational fluid dynamics. The boundary condition is for the downstream boundary of finite computing domains, which are computationally necessary for flow problems in an infinite domain. Existing specifications for this downstream boundary are unsatisfactory and require very large computing domains to avoid errors there from contaminating the simulation. A significant improvement in accuracy and computational cost would result from an improved specification of data on the downstream boundary.\n",
      "a9004375 EAR $50000 This research is to study earthquake fault behavior and regional deformation by means of newly developed theoretical techniques. These methods invert geodetic elevation changes, triangulation measurements, VLBI baseline data and tide gauge observations to recover the location and intensity of slip on shallow earthquake faults. The goal is to develop quantitative pictures of coseismic, postseismic and interseismic strain accumulation and release. This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.\n",
      "a9004376 EAR $50000 This proposal is to support a graduate student for two years to thoroughly research the Indonesian geodetic archives of the Dutch period in West Java and the archives of the Netherlands Geodetic Commission in Delft, and to perform a strain analysis across the Great Sumatran Fault System using historical triangulation data located in these archives and ongoing GPS measurements. This work will be coordinated with two Indonesian colleagues who will also be using the triangulation and GPS data as part of their doctoral studies. These data will provide important constraints on the decoupling of oblique convergence west of Sumatra into subduction normal to the margin between the Indian-Australian and Eurasian plates and right-lateral faulting parallel to it. Specifically, this comparison will enable us to measure horizontal strain rates both along the Sumatran fault to outline sections of differing fault behavior and far from the \"fault, in the southwest to constrain the partitioning os shear\" \"throughout the forearc, and in the northeast to study the accumulation of elastic strain across the Sumatran Fault system. In addition, these data will provide valuable information on earthquake-and fault-related processes in this very seismically active region. These data are particularly valuable since the Dutch often resurveyed parts of the triangulation network after earthquakes.\n",

      "a9004381 EAR $65000 This research is to emplace a 3-component seismometer at depth in the Cajon Pass borehole. At the 3.5 km depth of the borehole, this is important because this is a zone of seismogenic activity in crystalline rock, and deep sampling of local seismic events increases our understanding of the components of the P- and S- wave seismic spectra and the seismic coda in crust undisturbed by near surface phenomena. If spatial and temporal statistical properties of earthquake occurrence, for example, b-values and coda Q, contain important precursory information, the largest and cleanest seismogram sample set is available from sensors placed at depth. This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.\n",
      "a9004385 MCB $260000 Most plant viruses replicate in directly inoculated cells from a wide range of plants, but show exquisite host specificity with respect to initiating cell-to-cell and/or sustaining subsequent systemic spread through the plant. As a foundation for molecular study of the individual and collective role of plant virus genes in movement, systemic infection, and host specificity, the investigators have produced and characterized complete, infectious cDNA clones of several distinct bromoviruses of varying divergence in host range and genome sequence, and demonstrated that designed exchange of selected genes and gene segments between such viruses provides a powerful approach for identifying host specificity determinants and characterizing their behavior. Building on these tools and the strong general characterization of bromovirus molecular biology, they will now: follow infection movement at the cellular level to define the distinct stages at which systemic infection is blocked upon alteration of different virus genes; map host specificity effects to specific functional domains of several implicated virus genes and test a potentially powerful new approach to RNA virus genetic mapping based on natural RNA recombination; test preliminary indications that, contrary to the \"gating \" hypothesis, successful systemic infection requires mutual adaptation between the 3a movement gene and the 1a and 2a replication genes; determine whether the apparently post-replication influence of the 1a and 2a genes on systemic infection is truly independent of their known functions in RNA replication; and localize observed host specificity determinants in noncoding sequences surrounding the 3a gene and determine their possible influence on 3a gene expression. The results should provide clarifying concepts regarding the plant's response to the infective viruses.\n",

These studies are intended to elucidate 1) the nature of crust, mantle and subducted reservoirs, 2) the process by which these reservoirs interact, and 3) the effects of subduction recycling on geochemical budgets in the crust and mantle. 10Be measurements will be made at the University of Pennsylvania, with chemical separations made at DTM. K, Rb, Cs, Ba, Sr, U, Th and Pb measurements by isotope dilution and radiogenic isotope determinations will be made at DTM, along with Be, Li and some B concentration measurements.

      "a9004409 MCB $140000 This research focuses on understanding the significance and role of biotin enzymes in plant metabolism. To achieve this goal the unique somatic embryogenesis system of carrot has been utilized to study these proteins. During the development of somatic embryos of carrot the steady state levels of one of the six biotin-containing polypeptides increases dramatically. This biotin protein has been purified and polyclonal antibodies against it have been prepared. Using these antibodies a cDNA clone coding for this biotin protein has been isolated. This novel biotin protein is being investigated through the utilization of these antibodies and the cDNA clone as specific probes to investigate this novel biotin protein. These investigations concentrate on elucidating the function and regulation of this biotin enzyme. Initial experiments with the antibodies have identified this biotin protein as representing an acetyl CoA carboxylase. The function of this form of acetyl-CoA carboxylase in plant metabolism is being elucidated by 1) identifying the subcellular and tissue distribution of this protein in the carrot plant and 2) elucidating the molecular genetic mechanisms that regulate the accumulation of this protein in response to developmental and environmental signals. Biotin is an essential component of a set of enzymes that have important metabolic functions. The structure, function and regulation of a number of biotin enzymes is extensively studied in a diverse set of organisms. However, very little is known about the biotin enzymes of plants. This research investigates the function and regulation of plant biotin- containing enzymes in order to provide a better understanding of their role in plant metabolism.***//\n",

      "a9004438 EAR $26300 Silicate melts are the essence of igneous petrology and play an important role in the thermal evolution of the terrestrial planets. Unfortunately, silicate melts are difficult materials to study experimentally, theoretically and numerically. At the same time, computer simulations on supercomputers are gaining prominence in the earth sciences. The research described below is a collaborative effort between D.A. Yuen and F.J. Spera in the molecular modeling of molten germania (GeO2). The principal aim is to attempt to explain the properties of GeO2 melt, a classic network structure fluid, on the basis of intermolecular forces. Because GeO2 is an excellent analog of network silicate melts relevant to high temperature geochemistry (e.g., molten SiO2 NaAlSl2O6) and is potentially easier to simulate using molecular dynamics, a greater understanding of the chemical bonding, thermodynamic and transport properties of molten GeO2 will help us in turn to understand silicates better.\n",
      "a9004442 EAR $76000 The research will document how regional shifts in paleoenvironmental conditions during the Proterozoic-Cambrian transition may have influenced the record of extinctions and radiations of early Metazoa. Recent work in South Australia has shown that the inferred gap between the last appearance of complex vendozoans or the Ediacaran fauna and the first appearance of Cambrian-aspect traces is, in part, artifactual. It is suggested that the two faunas are in close stratigraphic and, by influence, close temporal proximity. In order to test this observation, detailed stratigraphic and paleontologic analyses will focus on the exceptional exposures of the Ediacaran-Cambrian transition in the Flinders Rangers, South Australia. Two principal data sets will be developed: 1) genetic stratigraphic sequence reconstructions of the intervl comprising the Upper Rawnsley Quartzite/Ediacara Member of the Pound Subgroup (uppermost Proterozoic?), Uratanna Formation (uppermost Proterozoic?-Lower Cambrian) and Parachilna Formation (Lower Cambrian); and 2) fossil/lithofacies associations of Ediacaran and earliest Cambrian trace and body fossils. Integration of these two data sets will allow the reconstruction of time- environment histories of faunal occurrences and a test of the role that ancient environments have played in biasing this record. By attempting to separate artifactual from factual signatures within the record, this research will have important implications for efforts to establish the causes and timing of the apparent demise of the Ediacara fauna and the dramatic subsequent radiation of the Cambrian fauna. The results of this work will contritube to on-going efforts to determine if there is a link between latest Proterozoic/Early Cambrian faunal turnover and a variety of geochemical and lithostratigraphic anomalies in the rock record. In addition, this research will improve our current understanding of the stratigraphy of a globally- significant Precambrian-Cambrian boundary section.\n",
      "a9004449 IBN $170000 There are two mouse dwarfing mutations that provide good models for studying the basis for induction of tissue specific transcription during embryogenesis. Both mutants lack the three pituitary cell types which produce prolactin, growth hormone, and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). The similarity of the mutant phenotypes suggests that the three missing cell types may derive from a common precursor cell and that at least two genes are involved in this differentiation pathway. Classical genetic and molecular biology will clarify how the affected genes normally interact and whether they have overlapping functions. Specifically, double heterozygotes and double mutants will be produced and the phenotypes characterized in terms of neurological, development, immune dysfunction and ablation of additional pituitary cell types. An intersubspecific backcross will be used to screen candidate genes for linkage to the Ames dwarf mutation (df) on chromosome 11 and for fine mapping of the df gene. Closely linked molecular probes will be used to generate a long range map of the df region using pulsed field gel electrophoresis. The df mutant was generated by X-irradiation, therefore the long range map may reveal evidence for a deletion or rearrangement, which would facilitate locating and subsequent cloning of the df gene. Linked molecular probes will be used to screen a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) library of the mouse. Pituitary cDNA and cross species homology will be used to identify the df gene within the YACs. Identification of the mutant gene by reverse genetics will clarify the basis for the failure of progenitor cells to differentiate into hormone producing cells and expand our understanding of the basic cellular commitment process. %%% The anterior pituitary is composed of a number of cell types, each specialized in the synthesis and secretion of different hormones. This study will determine if the products of genes essential for the development of the specific cell types act independently in each cell or whether their expression affects the development of neighbor cells.\n",
      "a9004455 MCB $255000 The overall goal of the project is a structural and functional analysis of the LexA protein of Escherichia coli. This protein undergoes a self-cleavage reaction, termed autodigestion, which inactivates its repressor function. In vivo, cleavage requires an activated form of another protein, RecA. In vito data indicate that RecA acts, not as a classical protease, but by stimulating LexA autodigestion. The proposed research will analyze further the mechanism of autodigestion and the role of RecA in stimulating this reaction, using a combination of genetics, biochemistry, and protein chemistry. Mutations in lexA and recA will be isolated which affect either the interaction between the two proteins, or the rates of one or both cleavage reactions. In particular, mutant proteins which cleave faster than wild-type LexA will be studied, with the goal of identifying and analyzing the rate-limiting step(s) in cleavage. It is planned to isolate crystals of LexA and of complexes with the operator and with activated RecA for use in x-ray crystallographic analysis. Structural information gained from this analysis can be correlated with the genetic and biochemical data. These studies are of general interest for the insights they offer into self-processing reactions, which are observed in a wide range of important biological molecules, including self- splicing RNA, growth factor receptors, viral polyproteins, and oncogene products.\n",
      "a9004457 EAR $55000 New paleomagnetic results from the Contessa section of the Umbrian Apennines (northern Italy) fill a 14 my sampling gap in previous studies and reveal a series of Albian reversed polarity intervals within the Cretaceous Normal Polarity Superchron. These new data imply a drastic revision of the mid Cretaceous polarity pattern. These reversed intervals could have broad applications in the correlation of the striking geologic characteristics of mid-Cretaceous sections, such as black shale deposition. This proposal seeks to confirm the presence of the Contessa reversed polarity intervals by a joint paleomagnetic and paleontologic investigation of the following two sections: (1) Poggio le Guaine (Umbrian Apennines, northern Italy) and (2) Tignale (Lombardian Basin, northern Italy). Project may enable refinement of geologic time scale and may reveal timing of deposition of important petroleum source rocks.\n",
      "a9004458 EAR $101335 Recent research by The Johns Hopkins University in the St. Mary River and Willow Creek formation of northwestern Montana has contributed important information about dinosaur faunas from upper coastal plain environments not otherwise available from most other regions that have yielded Late Cretaceous faunas. These new data are critical to the larger issues of their effects on extinction and speciation of large-bodied terrestrial vertebrates. Further field and laboratory work is essential for a better understanding of the faunal components of this upper coastal plain habitat and the effects of severe reduction in terrestrial environments through marine transgressions (i.e. habitat bottlenecks) and their release. With these goals in mind, the field work will be devoted to collecting specimens, mapping localities and detailing the stratigraphy of the St. Mary River and Willow Creek sites. Laboratory research will focus on the paleoecologic and evolutionary interpretation of the St. Mary River fauna necessary for a critical understanding of these habitat bottlenecks. This work includes 1) new approaches to the analysis of ontogenetic stages and evolution of St. Mary River taxa using landmark-based morphometrics, 2) new analyses of the feeding and locomotion of the St. Mary River animals on the kinematics of the jaws and teeth, and the kinematics and cross- sectional geometry of the limbs, and 3) interpretation of these data in terms of the evolutionary dynamics of St. Mary River taxa to the opening of terrestrial habitats through the regression of the Bearpaw Sea. This study will fill a significant void in our knowledge of an important component of Late Cretaceous ecosystems (life in upper coastal plain environments) at a time critical to the history of dinosaurs and other vertebrates (the Edmontonian Land Mammal Age at the close of the Cretaceous). In doing so, it will contribute to our understanding of how major environmental crises such as extensive transgressions and regressions relate to the evolutionary dynamics of large-bodied vertebrates.\n",
      "a9004461 DEB $38600 The Mid-Career Fellowship will provide the PI with the opportunity to learn the methodology of molecular evolutionary systematics. The PI will work in the laboratory of Dr. Robert K. Jansen, University of Connecticut to learn the methods of restriction site mapping of chloroplast and nuclear ribosomal DNA for phylogeny reconstruction. Procedures to be learned include DNA extraction, restriction endonuclease digestions, gel electrophoresis, filter hybridizations and the maintenance of clone banks. Familiarity with the appropriate literature and with the methodology of restriction site mapping and phylogenetic analysis of restriction site data will be accomplished. The organisms to investigated include the coneflower genera Dracopis, Echinacea, Ratibida, and Rudbeckia and probable related genera in Asteraceae tribe Heliantheae. The objectives of the investigations, in addition to the training aspects, are to solve the status of problematic taxa within genera, achieve phylogenetic insights among species and genera of the study organisms, and determine the affinities of the coneflowers with other genera of the Heliantheae.

      "a9004463 DMR $76715 This research involves the study of the stability of crystal surfaces to defect formation (i.e. steps, vacancies etc.) by employing high q-resolution low energy electron diffraction. The surface roughening of the (110) face of palladium, copper, cobalt, and rhodium will be investigated. This study has two objectives: 1) to determine if an instability in the surface inter-atomic potential, preceeding roughening, is a general phenomenon; 2) to determine how the electronic structure of the metals determine the roughening temperature of the (110) face relative to the melting temperature Tm. This work provides a benchmark test for models of the energetics of these surfaces near Tm and relates to new theoretical calculations of surface defect formation energies. In addition to the (110) face studies the high temperature structure of nickel(001) will also be studied.\n",
      "a9004464 ANI $338509 The research will focus on using a state transition formalism that is mathematically rigorous, yet easily accessible to the average engineer for the analysis and synthesis of network protocols. Building on past work in which the principal investigator has developed rudiments of a theory for communication network protocols, this research will develop a broad theoretical foundation, investigate sound and efficient methods for protocol analysis and synthesis, and apply these methods to the design of protocols. The analysis of protocols will address two kinds of concerns: logical properties and quantitative performance. Logical properties have to do with the functional requirements of a protocol and are determined by the reachable states and \"allowed behaviors\" of the protocol. The concerns formalized as logical properties include safety, progress, and real-time progress. Concerns that still need to be formalized included secrecy, authenticity, anonymity, privacy, and accessibility. Quantitative performance has to do with the throughput and response time characteristics of a protocol. Quantitative measures such as probability distributions or time bounds will be introduced into the state transition formalism. In addition, the research will include the development of methods for protocol construction by refinement and composition techniques for deriving protocol converters and adapters, as well as for maintaining and modifying network protocols in a changing environment.\n",
      "a9004477 MCB $200000 Tubulin plays a crucial role in morphogenesis as the primary component of microtubules. We propose to address two basic questions about these important structural proteins using the four a-tubulins of Drosophila: are any of the a-tubulin isotypes functionally specialized, and what regulatory mechanisms are responsible for achieving the correct ratios and concentrations of a-tubulins isotypes in each cell type? The multifunctionality of each a-tubulin isotype will be tested by determining the ability of one isotype to rescue developmental defects associated with mutations in another isotype. Transgenic strains carrying ectopic copies of each a-tubulin gene and mutations in two of the a- tubulins are available. An attempt will be made to generate mutations in the two remaining genes using P-element mutagenesis and PCR, an approach that allows the recovery of mutations with no detectable phenotype. Regulatory mechanisms operating to maintain tissue-appropriate a-tubulin pools will be identified by examining the ability of cells to 1) eliminate misexpressed a-tubulin isotypes produced from chimeric genes, and 2) respond to overexpression of appropriate isotypes from supernumerary tubulin genes. Genes encoding transacting a-tubulin regulatory factors will be sought by reverting the female sterility associated with overexpression of a maternal tubulin. The protein tubulin is an important structural component of most types of cells. It exists in a number of different forms, some present in all cells, others present only in certain specialized types of cells. The different forms of tubulin presumably serve different functions, but very little is known about what these functions are. This is a proposal to investigate the different functions of the different forms of tubulin.\n",
      "a9004480 EAR $83682 The Pacific northwest consists of a number of exotic terranes that were accreted to the continental margin beginning in the Cretaceous, however the tectonics and timing of the assembly is controversial. This renewal of a collaborative project will address the mechanics and processes of mid- Cretaceous Orogeny in the southeast Coast Plutonic Complex of British Columbia and its extension in the Crystalline Core of the North Cascades of Washington. Models of orogenesis to be tested include bulk shortening, transpressive thrusting, contractional thrusting and magmatic accretion. Evaluation of these models will utilize mineral thermobarometry, fabric analysis and U-Pb Zircon geochronology and pertains to a larger view of the orogen as either a collisional welt related to terrane accretion, or as a complex Andean-type magmatic arc developed on the edge of the North American craton.\n",
      "a9004491 IBN $244000 Dr.Tamkun's research is focused on the genetic and molecular mechanisms controlling the development of Drosophila melanogaster. This proposal concerns a new homeotic gene, kismet, identified by virtue of its genetic interactions with homeotic mutations. Genetic studies of the kismet locus have suggested that it is a target, or encodes a cofactor, of the Antennapedia gene product. Dr.Tamkun proposes to continue concurrent genetic and molecular analyses of kismet to determine its precise role in the determination of segmental identities during development. This will be accomplished through the use of germ-line and somatic clonal analyses, the continued characterization of genetic interactions between kismet and the homeotic loci of the Antennapedia and bithorax complexes, and the molecular cloning of kismet. Antibodies directed against the kismet protein will be generated and used to determine its subcellular distribution. The spatial and temporal expression of kismet during development will be followed using nucleic acid and antibody probes. The effect of various homeotic mutations on the expression of the kismet mRNA and protein will be examined to determine if this locus is a target of homeotic gene regulation. %%% The determination of body segment identity in fruit flies is an excellent system for studying the control of pattern formation in multicellular organisms. Mutations in one class of genes can result in the transformation of one body segment into the likeness of another, such as the transformation of an antenna into a leg. This work will further our understanding of how this class of genes functions.\n",
      "a9004492 BCS $300004 This research permits Dr. Minze Stuiver, together with colleagues from other laboratories, to conduct radiocarbon determinations on a series of German and Irish oak trees, which date from between ca. 5,000 and 8,000 B.C. The absolute ages of tree rings within this sample are independently determined through the construction of an annual ring chronology which starts at the present and works back into the past. With these new determinations, Dr. Stuiver will construct a series of calibrations which will allow the accurate conversion of radio carbon years into true age. Although the two are closely correlated they are not identical. Using this technique calibrations have been established from the present back to 5,000 B.C., and this project will extend this by approximately another 3,000 years. Because of the complicated relationship between \"radiocarbon age\" and \"true age,\" sometimes materials with different true ages can give the same radiocarbon age. At some radiocarbon ages, the possible range of true ages can be smaller and at others larger. For archaeologists these discrepancies can be extremely important when comparisons are made from one culture area to another. For the more recent period, Dr. Stuiver's calibration curve allows one to correct for this, and it is important that this be extended further back in time. This research is important not only to archaeologists but to astronomers and geophysicists, since the data provides information about changes in both solar radiation and in the earth's magnetic field.\n",
      "a9004498 IBN $319161 Fertility depends upon timely ovulation, which is induced by a pituitary hormone, gonadotropin, the secretion of which is, in turn, controlled by a releasing hormone synthesized in the hypothalamus. The neurons which synthesize this releasing hormone, Luteinizing hormone relcasing hormone ?LHRH!, are dispersed as individual cells or small clusters of cells across a broad region of the base of the brain. Apparently diffuse, the positioning of these LHRH neurons may be exquisitely regulated to facilitate integration of multiple internal and external factors to synchronize secretion and optimize reproductive success. Previous experiments using computer-assisted visualization techniques indicate that this group of neurons is composed of diverse subgroups. Using specialized staining procedures, i.e. immunocytochemistry, together with automated computerized visualization techniques, Dr. King will examine the hypotheses that: ?1! activity is enhanced in a \"core\" subgroup of neurons in relation to the LH surge, using a marker protein ?c-fos! as an indicator metabolic/secretory activity; ?2! the pattern of neural input to the diverse subgroups of LHRH neurons differ, using tracing techniques and specialized staining techniques to identify the transmitters involved; and finally ?3! a \"core\" subgroup controls the activity of other subgroups. These studies will yield important insights into the mechanisms that control this critical system of neurons.\n",
      "a9004502 BCS $84314 During the Miocene Epoch, 5-24 million years ago, there was an extensive radiation of hominoid primates in the Eastern Hemisphere. Their relationships with each other and with extant taxa are still unclear. Their functional anatomy and locomotor adaptations are clearly different from those of extant primates. This proposal seeks to characterize this radiation by descriptive and functional analyses, and by defining postcranial features by which Miocene taxa may be recognized as hominoids, or as primitive catarrhines. The research will continue the PI's previous studies on Sivapithecus, Kenyapithecus, and the recently discovered Simiolus, Turkanapithecus, and Afropithecus. The study will include studies of recently collected specimens, and on new specimens collected during the proposed research period. Functional analyses will be made of the postcrania of all known small apes from Kenya, comparisons will be made between Miocene catarrhines and platyrrhines, and possible indicators of terrestriality in Miocene hominoids will be explored.\n",
      "a9004511 EAR $160000 This research is to study deformation in a highly active thrust tectonic setting, the Tien Shan region in Western China. Crustal shortening across the range occurs largely by thrust faulting. The study will use classical geologic mapping of surface structures to estimate amounts of shortening across the range. Because Late Cenozoic sedimentary rocks are folded, bounds on the amounts of shortening will yield bounds on the rates of deformation. Mapping the geometry of deformed surface rocks will constrain models of the subsurface shapes of the deeper faults. Knowledge gained here will be applied to thrust deformation regimes in the U.S. such as the Transverse Ranges of Southern California. This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.\n",
      "a9004519 EAR $42500 This project investigates the evolutionary patterns of gastropod shell biota from subtropical and tropical Miocene to Recene assemblanges as a function of ecological opportunities and preservational biases created by hermit crabs. PI will study shell bionts associated with a guild of marine hermit crabs, living snails, empty and experimental tethered shells in two habitats (rocky intertidal and sandflat) in Purerto Penasco, Mexico. I will identify guilds of bionts associated with each shell inhabitant and formulate criteria by which these shell occupants (snail or hermit crab), and their prospective habitats, can be recognized in the fossil record. I will then determine, using the fossil record, if these bionts are (1) recurrent as guilds or change through time as a result of hermit crabs providing a novel substrate (the empty gastropod shell), (2) adequate to distingush the evolutionary history of the hermit crab, and (3) indicative of how much the gastropod fossil record has been biased by hermit crabs, thus potentially biasing gastropod paleoecology. Hermit crabs may have caused evolutionary breakthroughs in shell biota and this biota, in turn, may be indicative of the little known fossil history of hermit crabs and their shell use through time. Research will address how ecoligcal interactions may have changed through time.\n",
      "a9004526 IBN $77067 Organelle motility, in some eucaryotic cells, is dependent on microtubules, a complex network of proteins filaments found in the cytoplasm of the cell. Synaptic vesicles are motile secretory vesicles that store neurotransmitters. These vesicles are found in the axon, an extension of the nerve cell, responsible for transmitting signals to other cells. Various types of vesicular organelles exhibit different patterns of movement. This project will investigate and characterize, with the use of video microscopy, the movement of synaptic vesicles in the giant squid axon, and the motility of microtubule-dependent organelles in adrenocortical tumor cells. The movement of synaptic vesicles is considered a good model for other organelles that are influenced by hormones such as ACTH. Thus, this study will further our understanding of the molecular basis of organelle movement and the mechanisms by which the spatial and temporal distribution of organelles are regulated by cells.\n",
      "a9004528 MCB $4000 This symposium provides an up-to-date assessment of our knowledge of the biosynthesis, metabolism and molecular biology of polyamines and ethylene. Presentations by outstanding researchers in the field will provide a critical analysis of the involvement of polyamines and ethylene in plant growth, development, and responses to stress. The antagonistic roles of these molecules in senescence, plant stress and development will be examined, as well as the possible regulatory mechanisms for the ethylene and polyamine pathways. Polyamines and ethylene are the two important topics that will be discussed during the 5th Annual Penn State Symposium in Plant Physiology. Polyamines are compounds that have been implicated as markers for male fertility and in flower development. Evidence also suggests that polyamines may retard senescence. Ethylene has been shown to play an important regulatory role in many physiological processes including sex expression, flower initiation and the promotion of senescence. The purpose of this symposium is to address a variety of topics on polyamine and researchers working on these two distinct yet overlapping subjects and provide a catalyst for innovative approaches in the future. The symposium will provide students and post doctoral fellows an unusual opportunity to meet and interact in a small group setting with the leaders in this research area. The published proceedings will provide an up-to-date review of research in these rapidly advancing fields which will be of general value to students and scientists in colleges and universities, government, and industry.\n",
      "a9004534 EAR $110000 As slip accrues on a fault, stress concentrates at its ends, which must be relieved by a lengthening of the fault. This project will focus on three aspects of this process, the fault tip processes, the macroscopic fracture criterion that describes it, and the resulting growth process and fault slip/length scaling relations. Results are aimed at determining net geological effects but have a clear impact on earthquake hazard analysis as well.\n",
      "a9004537 MCB $274521 Our goal is to understand the mechanisms by which the expression of the maize anthocyanin biosynthetic enzymes is coordinately induced by the regulatory protein B. The B gene product is required for the steady state accumulation of mRNA from several genes encoding anthocyanin biosynthetic enzymes (structural genes), and we have recently demonstrated that the B gene plays a major role in stimulating the transcription of the structural genes. Transient cotransformation studies using plasmids carrying structural gene promoter sequences fused to luciferase, and plasmids which produce B protein, demonstrate B mediates an approximately 100 fold induction in luciferase activity. The deduced amino acid sequence of the B protein (obtained from the cDNA sequence) revealed a myc homologous region found in several DNA binding proteins and a negatively charged region characteristic of transcriptional activators. Both in vitro and in vivo assays will be used to: examine the in vivo modification of the B protein and its subcellular location and tissue distribution; dissect the regions of the B protein necessary for transcriptional control of the structural genes; determine the functions of these regions (transcriptional activation, DNA binding, protein/protein interactions, etc.); assess whether the B protein interacts directly with regulatory regions found in the structural genes; identify other proteins interacting with B; and investigate if B influences anthocyanin biosynthesis at levels in addition to transcription of the structural genes. The maize anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway represents one of a small number of pathways in higher plants for which regulatory proteins and their targets are known. Thus, studying the mechanisms utilized by B should reveal important information regarding regulated gene expression in higher plants.\n",
      "a9004547 EAR $90000 The mass extinction at the end of the Permian has been established as the greatest perturbation which the Earth's biosphere has experienced since the origin of metazoan life. Although relatively little is known about the cause of this mass extinction, even less is known on biotic conditions in its aftermath or the nature of biotic recovery from this event. Fossil faunas and limestones in the Lower Triassic Virgin Member of the Moenkopi Formation (southern Nevada and southwestern Utah), deposited 5 my after the end of the Permian, present an opportunity to learn how benthic faunas in shallow marine carbonate environments were faring in this recovery interval. Preliminary study of the Virgin limestones indicates deposition in a normal marine environment with benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages of relatively low species richness. Of potentially great significance are intervals of apparent normal marine stromatolites, which may represent temporary expansion from marginal marine refugia into normal marine settings due to restriction of grazers, caused by the mass extinction. Evidence for the beginning of recovery is demonstrated through the presence of abundant specimens of the earliest articulate crinoid, which had evolved from some unknown Paleozoic inadunate that survived the crisis. Research will illuminate the way in which biotas recover from mass extinctions.\n",
      "a9004549 MCB $411616 During the differentiation of B and T-lymphocytes, antibody and T-cell antigen receptor genes undergo a complicated series of recombination events. All of the antigen receptor variable region genes contain a pair of highly conserved recombination signal sequences which are the targets of a site-specific recombinase. In an attempt to identify and characterize the factors involved in this recombination process, Dr. Aguilera has sought nuclear factors which might interact specifically with the recombination signals. With the use of sensitive electrophoretic assays, DNA binding factors have been identified in recombination-positive pre-B cells which bind specifically to the V-(D)-J recombination signals. The next goals of this research are: (1) To further characterize the lymphocyte nuclear factors which interact specifically with the recombination signals; (2) To continue experiments leading to the purification of these binding factors; (3) To clone and characterize the genes encoding nuclear factors which interact with the V-(D)-J recombination signals. The long term objective of this research is the characterization of the enzymatic machinery involved in antigen receptor gene recombination in cells of the immune system. These events underlie the generation of the vast diversity of specific receptor molecules that recognize and enable an individual to develop an immune response to a wide array of foreign substances.\n",

These studies provide valuable insight into the mechanisms of molecular motion and also into the rapidly emerging medical area of magnetic imaging of the human body. A variety of newly developed ESR relaxation techniques are to be employed, and the necessary theoretical frameworks for understanding these experiments are also to be developed and extended.

      "a9004555 EAR $124000 This research is to study the large-scale aspherical and spherically averaged structure of the earth from long-period seismic data. The variety of three-dimensional earth models in the literature and their general inability to provide detailed fits to the data indicate where work is needed. Two areas will be emphasized: the expansion and interpretation of a dataset of PIP and PKIKP equivalent modes, some of which are very anomalously split, and the detailed spectral analysis of long- period surface wave packets which should provide extremely good lateral resolution of upper mantle structure. The goal is to combine this information with datasets of structure coefficients and long-period travel times to constrain global models of aspherical structure.\n",
      "a9004556 EAR $144000 This research interprets seismicity and geodetic data in terms of the geometry and stressing of locked fault zones which will rupture in large earthquakes. The studies will be carried out in the framework of the asperity model which regards a portion of a seismically active fault zone as being effectively locked against slip, except in large earthquakes, while adjacent portions of the zone slip aseismically, or with lower level seismicity, and do not accumulate comparable stress. The initial focus will be on modelling of the Shumagin Islands subduction segment in Alaska, and the Parkfield region along the San Andreas fault.

      "a9004557 MCB $243000 When neutrophils are activated by contact with bacteria, foreign particles, and various chemicals such as phorbol esters, they generate a large quantity of superoxide by means of the NADPH oxidase and its associated electron transport chain. Most of this superoxide is converted to hydrogen peroxide, and most of the peroxide is converted to hypochlorous acid (HOC1) by the action of myeloperoxidase. In the presence of the spin-trapping agent 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO), activated neutrophils yield the nitroxide adducts of both superoxide (DMPO-OOH) and hydroxyl radical (DMPO-OH). The origin of DMPO- OOH is controversial, and many workers believe that it arises from breakdown of DMPO-OOH. In addition, the principal investigator recently showed that HOC1 catalyzes the incorporation of ?17O!H2O into ?17O!DMPO-OH, thus suggesting an alternative origin of DMPO-OH in neutrophils. In these model studies, the DMPO-OH was further oxidized by HIC1 to 55-dimethyl 1-2 pyrrolidone-N-oxyl (DMPOX). The latter product has not been seen with activated neutrophils. However, the principal investigator has found that DMPOX is readily converted by NADPH into an EPR-silent species, presumably the hydroxylamine. The proposed research will test the hypothesis that activated neutrophils form DMPO-OH and DMPOX from HOC1 but subsequently reduce the DMPOX with NADPH generated by the respiratory burst. Synthetic DMPOX will be incubated with activated neutrophils and its reduction monitored by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). The role of NADPH as a source of reducing equivalents will be examined with site-specific inhibitors, chemical agents that oxide NADPH, and a recycling system for regenerating NADPH. The reaction of DMPOX with NADPH will be quantitated and the reaction product identified. In addition, activated neutrophils will be incubated with DMPO in the presence of 17O-labeled O2 and H2O to determine the origin of the DMPO-OH produced. Enzymic reactions that reduce nitroxides and oxidize the corresponding hydroxylamines may be responsible, in part, for the conflicting observations of radicals formed by neutrophils using spin-trapping techniques . The proposed research will help clarify the basis of this inconsistency.\n",
      "a9004559 EAR $69000 PIs will investigate the tectonic setting, magmatic origin and stratigraphic significance of altered volcanic ash beds (K- bentonites) in the Middle and Upper Ordovician strata of Baltoscandia and to compare these data with similar data from North America. Preliminary studies strongly suggest these K- bentonite beds on both sides of lapetus had a common source and a common tectonic setting. If this indication proves correct, the most widespread of these beds will have profound event- stratigraphic implications for the Ordovician, and our understanding of Laurentia and Baltica plate positions during the Taconian orogeny will be substantially improved. Similarly, the abundance of Silurian K-bentonites throughout Baltoscandia and the UK indicates ongoing plate-margin volcanism from Llandovery through Ludlow time. PIs will collect samples of the most extensive beds from cores and outcrops in Estonia, Sweden and Norway. They will add to existing information on the biostratigraphic position of these beds and use chemical fingerprinting of both bulk samples and selected phenocrysts to make accurate correlations with North American beds. These will be compared with trans-Atlantic stratigraphic relations of K- bentonites suggested by traditional biostratigraphy and by graphic correlation using conodonts. We will also obtain high- resolution Ar age spectra and U-Pb dates from biotite and zircon separates from biostratigraphically well-constrained K-bentonites that will add key ages to the Ordovician time scale. Trace element data will be plotted on discrimination diagrams to interpret the tectonic and magmatic settings of these beds.\n",
      "a9004560 EAR $31974 Southwestern Utah has an essentially complete Cenomanian- Turonian stratigraphic record of the transgressive-regressive cycle along the western margin of the Greenhorn Sea which also records the early history of the Sevier orogenic foreland basin. This project will develop lithostratigraphic, biostratigraphic, and radiometric means of correlation across the entire sequence. As the marine part of the cycle has already been studied in some detail and correlated regionally, research will concentrate on marginal marine and terrestrial deposits and faunas. Correlation of these strata is critical for interpretation of the evolution of the Sevier orogenic foreland basin. Detailed measured sections will be taken and brackish water faunas and terrestrial faunas will be examined throughout the sequence. Radiometric dates will be employed to constrain and test correlations. This record of marginal marine and terrestrial taxa will be the most extensive of this age in the world and will allow for evaluation of extinction and evolutionary patterns of marine through terrestrial communities during a single transgressvie-regressive marine cycle.\n",

The specific objectives are: (1) the determination of the crystal structure of the oxygenated and deoxygenated forms of subunit II of Limulus polyphemus hemocyanin; (2) Comparison of the oxy and deoxy structures, based on data from a single crystal if necessary, for the elucidation of the active site geometry, including the orientation of the molecular oxygen with respect to the two copper centers and protein ligands; and (3) The crystallization of other interesting hemocyanins, such as subunit IIIa, another subunit of Limulus hemocyanin with an active site chemistry much more like a typical molluscan than arthropodan hemocyanin, the whole molecules of Limulus hemocyanin and hybrid and cooperative Limulus hexamers in forms suitable for x-ray diffraction analysis.\n",
      "a9004567 MCB $409000 G proteins are signal transducers found in a variety of eukaryotic organisms, from humans to fruit flies, and from slime molds to yeasts; they are heterotrimers (of alpha, beta, and gamma subunits) that play crucial roles in many types of receptor-mediated signalling processes. In plants, cells respond to a variety of hormonal and environmental stimuli; many of these are known or thought to involve receptors. However, the function of G proteins in plant signal transduction processes has not been demonstrated. This laboratory has recently isolated a gene (GPA1) coding for a G protein alpha subunit (G alpha 1) from the small flowering plant, Arabidopsis thaliana. This is the first G protein gene identified in any plant. The long term goal of this laboratory is to study signal transduction processes in plants which require G protein functions, and to compare and contrast G protein functions between animals, plants and simple eukaryotes. The immediate objective proposed is to characterize the GPA1 gene and its product G alpha 1 in detail. The time and tissue specific patterns of GPA1 expression, the intracellular localization of the G alpha 1 protein, and the function of G alpha 1 in the plant will be examined. A wide range of approaches will be taken; they include transcriptional and translational gene fusions, transgenic plants, analysis using antibodies, and mutational analysis. G proteins are known to be very important in animals and simple eukaryotes. They are necessary for a variety of cellular signalling processes such as hormonal stimulation, photoreception by cells of the retina, chemotaxis of slime molds during aggregation, and the yeast mating response. There is evidence that some plant signal transduction processes also require G proteins, although, thus far, very little is known about this in plants. This laboratory has recently shown that G proteins are present in plants by cloning a gene for a G protein subunit. Understanding the functions of G proteins in plants will be an important contribution to our knowledge of cellular signal transduction processes in plants.\n",
      "a9004568 IBN $240000 The objective of the proposed research is to use a molecular genetic approach to gain an understanding of the developmental mechanisms that regulate cell expansion in tip-growing plant cells. To achieve this goal, Dr. Schiefelbein has chosen to study elongation in root hairs, a relatively simple and accessible cell type in plants. Mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana have been isolated that synthesize root hairs with irregular growth patterns. He will initially concentrate on two mutants (rhd3 and rhd4) that, based on preliminary analyses, are likely to harbor mutations in genes intimately involved in root hair elongation. The specific research approaches will include: 1) characterization of the ultrastructure, microfilaments, and ion currents in the wild type and mutant root hairs, 2) linkage analysis and isolation of new alleles of the RHD3 and RHD4 genes, 3) RFLP mapping and molecular cloning of the genes by chromosome walking with a yeast artificial chromosome library, and 4) isolation and stepwise characterization of additional genes affecting root hair elongation. The results from this research are expected to provide basic information on the mechanism regulating expansion in tip-growing cells, as well as to define specific genes governing root hair elongation in plants.\n",
      "a9004570 IBN $48100 Turtles (chelonians) exhibit the remarkable ability to survive long periods without breathing. For example during diving in aquatic turtles, breatholds for 1 to 2 hours have been observed. The organ that plays a critical role in the turtles remarkable breatholding ability during diving is the heart. The heart of the turtle is comprised of only 3 chambers (as compared to the 4 chambers of mammals and humans). The unique anatomy results in the potential for the blood returning from the body to either circulate through the lungs or to bypass the lungs. When the blood bypasses the lungs it is referred to as a right-to-left intracardiac shunt. Previous scientific investigations have reported that the amount of blood bypassing the lung is often coupled with ventilatory patterns, with the right-to-left shunt increasing during breatholding. In contrast, during breathing the amount of blood circulating to the lungs increases and the right- to-left shunt is reduced. While a large right-to-left shunt would produce harmful results in mammals and humans, the ability of reptiles to bypass the lungs may play several important roles during breatholding. These include reducing the energy expenditure of the heart, the \"metering\" of oxygen from the lung (analogous to a scuba tank) and maintaining the balance of fluids between the lung and blood. However, the precise process by which the heart of turtles can accomplish varying levels of blood shunting have been controversial and not well understood. The study proposed by Dr. Hicks will utilize a combination of sophisticated radiological techniques, blood flow measurements and injections of tracer gases to image the heart and determine blood flow patterns through the heart during a variety of physiological conditions. These techniques and the experiments outlined in Dr. Hicks' proposal will determine if the process of blood shunting results either from factors external to the heart (i.e. regulation by the lung) or factors intrinsic to the heart to understanding the evolutionary development of the cardiovascular system in vertebrate animals. His elucidation of the mechanism of blood shunting in reptiles will help to answer the question of what functional role blood shunting plays in this ancient but important group of animals.\n",
      "a9004573 EAR $71978 Pure CO2 fluid inclusions commonly occur in metamorphic rocks which are known to have crystallized in the presence of an H20-rich fluid. Densities are consistent with peak metamorphic conditions, but their composition is not. This project will investigate the possibility that processes attending crystal plastic flow and dynamic recrystallization of quartz may result in loss of H2O from inclusions, with CO2 remaining in the host quartz. Samples of metamorphic rocks showing strain gradients in hand specimen will be utilized to determine the variations of composition and density of fluid inclusions in relation to gradients in strain and variations of deformation mechanisms. Results are expected to clarify origins of pure CO2 inclusions and may provide a new perspective for studies of high temperature deformation mechanisms.\n",

These involve geometric Lorenz attractors for systems of equations derived from mathematical physics, the structure of the standard map for large values of the parameter, and cocycles over an irrational rotation and Schrodinger operators with quasi-periodic coefficients. Dynamical systems is the mathematics of how objects move. The Lorenz system of differential equations describes motion in three dimensions.

This laboratory's research efforts are focused on the structure and function of one such small nuclear RNA designated snRNA U14. This evolutionarily conserved eukaryotic lmwRNA species possesses a conserved ability to intermolecularly base-pair with 18s ribosomal RNA. Molecular and cellular characterization of mouse and Xenopus U14 as well as genetic analysis of yeast U14 strongly indicate a role in eukaryotic rRNA synthesis and/or processing. Recent experiments have quite surprisingly revealed the positioning of the mouse and Xenopus U14 genes within intron 5 of the constitutive-expressed cognate hsc70 heat shock gene, a unique genomic organization for an snRNA. The experiments outlined in this investigation will examine the synthesis, structure, and function of eukaryotic snRNA U14. The biosynthetic pathway responsible for U14 biogenesis defined. The synthesis and cellular distribution of U14 will be studied in both normally and abnormally growing cells. U14's role in rRNA processing as well as possible involvement in the heat shock/stress response will be examined. Finally, structural studies will define an evolutionarily conserved U14 secondary structure, determine those U14/18s rRNA sequences involved in intermolecular hybridization, and characterize the U14-associated proteins of a putative U14 ribonucleoprotein complex. Results from these studies will lead to a better understanding of the structure/function relationships of this unique and evolutionarily important eukaryotic lmwRNA.***//\n",

Preliminary results indicating that wide distribution of brachiopods promoted survival during the extinction will be examined more closely, and the pattern will be examined to see whether or not it holds in each of six paleoenvironmental zones arrayed from shallow to deep environments.

This project will investigate a relatively well- exposed area- the Columbus Promontory- in order to address emplacement mechanics and physical conditions of fault development on several scales.

      "a9004609 IBN $210000 One of the most active and currently vigorously pursued research area in endocrinology in the identification of the receptors for the various hormones. An understanding of the role of hormones receptors in activation of specific genes will further our knowledge regarding the specifically of hormone action. The overall aim of this research proposal is to gain an indepth understanding of one of the primary actions of the insect juvenile hormone: The induction of the yolk protein precursor, Vitellogenin (Vg). Juvenile hormone is a sesquiterpenoid molecule and as such chemically unique among animal hormones. It is hypothethized that also here receptors mediate the hormonal message in analogy to the findings for vertebrate steroid and thyroid hormones. The fundamental importance to endocrinology in general is implied. In order to achieve this goal, the receptor for JH (so far physiologically identified) will be purified to homogeneity. Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies to this receptor will be generated and used to monitor the stage and sex specific occurrence of this receptor. In addition, the Vg gene will be isolated and the hormone responsive element (HRE) will be identified. Since species such as cockroaches date evolutionarily back to more than 200 M years, analogous findings to those from certain vertebrate hormones will gain significance in evolutionary terms. Cockroach species have been amenable for basic research. Many of the aspects regarding the control of insect reproduction have been worked out on appropriate cockroach species first. The easy manipulation of these animals and their cost efficiency make them perhaps the animals of choice for certain basic research in biology. Furthermore, the identification and characterization of the receptor for JH may lead to the design of new chemicals that can be used in control of agriculturally and medically injurious insect species, since hormone receptors are the key to hormone action.\n",
      "a9004611 MCB $276000 The project encompasses the investigation of the molecular basis of sequence specific recognition by DNA binding proteins and, in particular, the mechanism by which type II endonucleases achieve their high degree of binding and catalytic specificity. SmaI, XmaI and XcyI each recognize the hexanucleotide CCCGGG. SmaI cleaves between the internal CpG, while XmaI and XcyI are perfect isoschizomers and cleave between the external cytosines. Cytosine methylation within the recognition site inhibits the activity of the enzymes. It is the aim of this proposal to focus on the DNA binding properties of the endonucleases and to compare the mechanism by which each of the proteins interacts with the same DNA sequence. The project involves structural characterization of the endonucleases and analysis of the protein-DNA interaction in terms of the overall topology of the protein-DNA complexes, specific base and phosphate contacts and the potential for protein-induced bending and unwinding of the DNA. The effect of cytosine methylation on the binding properties of the endonucleases will also be investigated. The comparative study of the endonucleases will reveal whether there are any similarities in their mechanism of molecular recognition or whether each is characterized by a distinct mode of interaction with DNA. Furthermore, the enzymes also provide a good model system for analyzing the potential roles of cytosine methylation in protein-DNA interactions.\n",
      "a9004614 EAR $74315 The measurement of natural 222Rn and deliberately introduced SF6 can be used to accurately detect and quantify groundwater delivery to stream flow. Experiments, involving the simultaneous measurement of 222RN and SF6 will be conducted in the Santa Fe River in Florida. The detection of anomalously high levels of 222Rn in the stream will permit the identification of locations of groundwater input. The observed variations between SF6 and 222Rn will be used to determine accurate gas exchange rates, which are needed to estimate the groundwater component of surface discharge. The rate of gas exchange, which can be expressed as a reaeration coefficient, is also a determining factor in assessing water quality in a stream. Thus, the measurement of 222Rn and SF6 together will yield another geochemical technique for assessing the water quality of aquatic systems. Measurements of the D/H and 180/160 ratios in water samples collected from the Sante Fe during a 222Rn survey following a major precipitation event when the difference between the precipitation derived surface runoff and the well integrated groundwater component is maximized will provide an independent check on estimates of groundwater delivery based on the 222Rn data. The proposed research will benefit hydrologists and water resource managers by establishing a powerful new geochemical technique for examining the interconnections between groundwater and surface flow. In addition, the research will provide a hydrologic and water quality data base not easily obtained by conventional methods.\n",
      "a9004624 DMS $48810 This project will support research on inverse problems in partial differential equations. In particular the research will focus on the impedance tomography problem, the problem of characterization of the Dirichlet to Neumann map, the inverse conductivity problem for anisotropic conductivities in dimensions greater than or equal to three, and related problems in inverse scattering and inverse problems that arise in differential geometry. When an electric potential is applied to the surface of a conducting body, the resulting current flux across the surface depends on the internal resistance of the body. For this reason, voltage and current measurements made on the boundary of an object can be used to probe the internal structure of the body. The problem is to determine as much information as possible about the internal resistivity from measurements of voltage potentials and corresponding current fluxes at the boundary. This problem, often referred to as impedance computed tomography or electrical impedance imaging, arose in geophysics from attempts to determine the composition of the earth. More recently, it has been proposed as a potentially valuable diagnostic tool for the medical and biological sciences.\n",

      "a9004643 INT $0 The purpose of this travel award is to allow Dr. Douglas F. Williams to continue the dialogue with the Soviet Academy of Sciences (SAS) and USSR Ministry of Geology (MINGEO) about a program for long-term research of Lake Baikal as it relates to global climate change, biogeochemical cycles, continental rifting and geophysics, and joint US-USSR continental scientific drilling. This would build directly on earlier discussions about a possible Baikal Drilling Project (BDP) held at the University of South Carolina in July 1989 and at Yaroslavl, Moscow and Irkutsk in August 1989. Dr. Williams would also be able to discuss with his Soviet counterparts the results of the first processing by US geophysicists of Soviet geophysical multi- channel seismic (MCS) data from Lake Baikal, collected by the Institute of Oceanology (Moscow) in the summer of 1989. That would be particularly important because is shows real progress in the step-wise process of initiating US-USSR basic geoscience research on Lake Baikal. This project fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading researchers in the United States and the U.S.S.R. to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence in the field of basic scientific research on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.\n",
      "a9004646 EAR $36034 Recent mechanically based treatments flow and erosion in bends indicate that river meandering is a highly nonlinear, autocatalytic process wherein diverse, yet self-organized, meander geometries arise independently of variations in flow and erodibility of valley-floor alluvium. The nonlinearity resides in the fact that the channel configuration at each instant evolves from a previous channel state in accordance with mechanical conditions imposed on the flow (and associated boundary stress field) by that previous state. A suitable equation of motion can be written which describes the essentials of this nonlinear behavior. Numerical simulations will be conducted to clarify how the diversity of bend forms that can occur at any instant, and the tendency for certain of these forms to recur over time, are compatible features of meander trains that naturally arise from the nonlinearity of the process.\n",

      "a9004655 DMS $64150 The principal investigator will study index problems for first-order singular operators which have specified form near singular strata. This class of operators includes classical geometric operators with Dirac signatures and those having conic type strata. The main tool to be exploited in this investigation is the \"wedge calculus\" and its extension to pseudomanifolds. For most of the twentieth century operators with various types of singular sets have been the mainstay of theoretical physics. Earliest of these was one first studied by Dirac. This operator had the property that while it was zero everywhere except at a single point, its integral, or the area under its graph, was positive. At first such operators used by physicists had no sensible mathematical explanation. But eventually mathematicians were able to explain them by changing the context of their original interpretation. The principal investigator will analyze a large set of operators which includes Dirac's.\n",

The resulting elements from k sampled blocks from a sequence of stationary m-dependent random variables will be used to provide bootstrap estimators of parameters and the properties of the estimators will be examined. Questions of robustness of these resampling procedures will be investigated. Notions of data depth for directional data will be developed along with nonparametric tests for them and corresponding classifications of data.

      "a9004662 INT $17420 This award supports an international workshop on modern light microscopy to be held in Mendoza, Argentina from November 12- 18, 1990. The U.S. organizer is Dr. Shinya Inoue of the Woods Hole Marine Biological Laboratory in Massachusetts. His Argentinean counterpart is Dr. Mario Burgos of the National University of Cuyo in Mendoza. The speakers consist of four experienced microscopists from each country, the U.S. and Argentina. Video microscopy is a powerful tool for biology, medicine and materials science. For this reason, this workshop assumes greater importance than just discussions of equipment or techniques. The three general areas to be covered are: (A) foundations of light microscopy, including analysis of image resolution and contrast, impact of illumination, and principles and applications of phase contrast, differential interference contrast, polarization microscopy, confocal imaging, and optical sectioning; (B) fluorescence microscopy, including target-specific probes, instruments, and ratio imaging; and (C) video microscopy and digital image processing and analysis, including video principles, contrast and feature enhancement, noise integra- tion, and examples of applications. The workshop will bring together Latin American and U.S. scientists to explore future collaborations. Also they will share with academic and industrial investigators, including advanced graduate students in Latin America, the forefronts of this emerging field in order to encourage applications in research. The mornings will generally be devoted to lectures and discussions, and the afternoons to laboratory demonstra- tions with extensive opportunities for hands-on experience with modern optical and video equipment. The lecturers are well-experienced, having participated in similar workshops before at the Marine Biological Laboratory, in Woods Hole, Massachusetts.\n",
      "a9004665 MCB $337040 Turnip crinkle virus (TCV) will be used as a model to study symptom manifestation, defective interfering (DI) RNA formation and RNA recombination. The TCV system is uniquely suited for these studies; it is the only plant or animal virus associated with avirulent and virulent sat-RNAs which can recombine their genomes and DI RNAs which can be generated de novo from in vitro synthesized TCV transcripts. Furthermore, two isolates of TCV have distinct biological properties: subviral RNAs only produce symptoms when associated with the TCV-M isolate and DI RNAs have only been generated from the TCV-B isolate. Chimeric TCV genomic RNAs will be constructed to ascertain which region of TCV RNA is involved in differential symptom production and DI formation. The mechanism by which DI RNAs and sat-RNA recombinants are formed will also be investigated. The putative internal replicase recognition sequence in sat-RNA C, found at the right hand junction of all recombinant sat-RNAs, will be deleted, altered and/or moved from its current location to determine the importance of the sequence in recombination. A copy choice model versus a breakage and ligation model for the formation of descendance RNAs will also be tested. Sat-RNA transcripts with defined mutations, allowing differential replication of plus or minus strands, will be added to both protoplasts and plant extracts. RNA recombination will be detected by polymerase chain reaction techniques.***//\n",
      "a9004666 MCB $321067 The immune response pattern of tadpoles of the South African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis, is distinct from that of the adult. Metamorphosis is a transitional period that separates the two patterns. The objectives of this research are to examine the hypothesis that development of the adult immune system requires metamorphosis and is characterized by the loss of a major population of larval lymphocytes and replacement with new, adult- type lymphocytes. To prove or disprove the hypothesis, larval thymus or spleen cell populations will be cytogenetically labelled, and their fate during and after metamorphosis will be followed. By implanting triploid thymus or spleen into diploid hosts and blocking metamorphosis in some of them, it will be determined whether renewal of T and B cell populations at metamorphosis is dependent on thyroid hormones. Because metamorphosis is regulated by thyroid hormones whose effects may be modulated by corticosteroid hormones, the direct effects of thyroid hormones and corticosteroid hormones in promoting metamorphosis-dependent changes in the immune system will be analyzed. These studies will contribute to a better understanding of the ontogeny of the immune system of amphibians, the mechanisms that regulate production of lymphocytes during ontogeny, the neuroendocrine regulation of development of the immune system, and how immunological tolerance to \"self\" develops.\n",
      "a9004667 MCB $225000 Dr. Peters proposed to study how protein structure controls the dynamics of the enthalpy and volume changes associated with the dissociation of carbon monoxide from myoglobin. The method of analysis is time-resolved photoacoustic calorimetry. Time-resolved photoacoustic calorimetry measures the dynamics of the enthalpy and volume changes for reactions that are initiated by light. The resolution of the experiment is such that for reactions which occur in less than 100 nanoseconds, the sum of the enthalpy and volume changes are measured. For reactions occurring between 100 nanoseconds and 20 microseconds the dynamics of enthalpy and volume changes can be obtained. For the past three years Dr. Peters has been examining the dynamics of enthalpy and volume changes associated with the photodissociation of carbon monoxide from sperm-whale, horse and human myoglobins. He has found evidence for a new intermediate in sperm-whale myoglobin that is formed upon the dissociation of carbon monoxide which involves the breaking of a salt bridge and re- organization of the protein structure. Following these initial observations Dr. Peters would like to investigate the nature of this protein structural change. He will examine mutants of sperm-whale and human myoglobin, engineered by site directed mutagenesis, to determine the origin of the barrier to the formation of this intermediate. Also, using combinations of buffers he will examine pH titration curves for the energetics and dynamics of the myoglobins in order to ascertain if structural changes are occurring within the protein that may effect the acidity of some amino acids.\n",
      "a9004669 MCB $170000 The role of amino acid side chains in decarboxylation reactions catalyzed by Pseudomonas cepacia 2,2-dialklglycine decarboxylates (EC 4.1.1.64), a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent enzyme which decarboxylates 2,2-dialklglycines and D-amino acids but transaminates L-amino acids, will be investigated using site directed mutagenesis. The function of active site histidine and lysine side chains will be studied by replacing these amino acids by alanine and glycine, respectively, and then using various small molecules to mimic the function of the lost side chains. These are prosthetic or auxiliary catalysts. This approach provides a direct test for the function of an active site side chain: If catalysis by the added molecules tends to be more efficient with molecules that are more basic, then the original side chain is likely to function as a base. If catalysis by the added molecules tends to be less efficient with molecules that are more basic, then the original side chain likely functions as an acid. A variety of small bases, first used by Toney and Kirsch to test the function of a lysine in aspartate aminotransferase ?Science 243, 1485 (1989)!, will be used to test the lysine of the dialklglycine decarboxylase. A series of imidazoles will be used to test the function of the active histidine in the same enzyme.\n",
      "a9004670 MCB $216000 We have been studying the structural features of insulin analogs in solution as part of project to engineer proteins with altered biologic and physical properties. A striking finding has been the degree of flexibility observed for insulin in solution. Most notably, the binding potency of several analogs correlates with overall molecular flexibility. Selected mutations and bridging structures can lock conformational substructures that are not productive for receptor recognition. Moreover, mutations that increase molecular flexibility appear to reverse these effects. Therefore, we have identified a system for relating protein structures in crystals, in solution (NMR) and at the receptor surface. It appears that changes in molecular structure are necessary accompaniments to high affinity receptor recognition. In the current proposal I have outlined three complimentary approaches for defining the structural requirements of insulin action. First, site-site interactions between insulin and the insulin receptor will be positively identified. In this fashion, comparative binding surfaces of insulin and the insulin receptor will be constructed, using the three- dimensional crystal structure of insulin as a template. Second, solution structures of selected series of analogs are being analyzed by NMR and CD spectroscopy. Specific structural features will be correlated with receptor binding potency. Finally, increasing concentrations of truncated receptor homologs will be added to solutions of insulin and selected analogs; the effects on insulin structure will be characterized. In combination these studies should identify the structural features in solution that are necessary for receptor binding and the changes in structure that accompany binding. Furthermore, these studies will help to provide a more general foundation for studying relationships between protein crystal structures, solution structures, and changes in structure that occur during complex formation.\n",
      "a9004671 MCB $95000 Meiosis is a complex cellular process that occurs during the sexual reproduction of all eukaryotic organisms including man. The process of meiosis involves the assembly of complex cellular structures, including the synaptonemal complex, and the spindle. We are studying two genes required for normal meiosis in Drosophila: (1) c(3)G, which is required for the assembly of the synaptonemal complex, and (2) cand, which encodes a kinesin-like mechanochemical protein that is required for the assembly of the spindle. We have refined the cytogenetic localization of c(3)G in order to facilitate the isolation of the gene by molecular cloning. We now propose to isolate the c(3)G locus by chromosome walking, and use the cloned gene to determine the nature and subcellular localization of the gene product by DNA sequencing and antibody staining. We also propose to identify additional genes required for synaptonemal complex and spindle assembly by screening for mutations that display second-site noncomplementation of c(3)G or cand. Gametes are formed in sexually reproducing organisms by an intricate sequence of two cell divisions known as meiosis. During meiosis special structures are formed in the dividing reproductive cells which ensure that a precise and complete set of chromosomes is distributed into each gamete. The cellular structures and mechanisms of meiosis are essential for normal reproduction, since gametes carrying too many or too few chromosomes give rise to grossly abnormal or inviable offspring. The detailed mechanisms of meiosis are as yet poorly understood. This is a proposal to study genes of the fruit fly Drosophila whose products play an essential role in meiosis.*** //\n",

      "a9004693 IBN $255000 Dr. Fosket has isolated and sequenced two soybean beta-tubulin genes (SB1 and SB2) which exhibit different patterns of developmental and organ specific expression. However, both genes are expressed in elongating internodes and they are strongly and rapidly down regulated at the transcriptional level when etiolated seedlings are exposed to light. He will determine the nature of the cis-acting elements controlling the internodal expression of SB1 and SB2. Constructs in which a promoterless E. coli beta-glucosidase (GUS) reporter gene is driven by the SB1 and SB2 promoters have been made and transferred to tobacco by Agrobacterium mediated transformation, and the chimeric genes are expressed in the transgenic tobacco plants. The effect of deletions and mutations of the putative promoter regions of SB1 and SB2 on the expression of the GUS reporter gene in transgenic tobacco will be determined to identify the regulatory elements responsible both for their expression in elongating internodes and for their light induced down regulation. GUS enzymatic activity assays and S1 nuclease protection experiments will be used to verify that GUS enzymatic activity is a reflection of the transcriptional activity of the chimeric genes. The precise cellular localization of GUS activity in the transgenic tobacco plants will be determined histochemically, while the cell specific expression of the SB1 and SB2 genes in soybean internodes will be will be determined by means of in situ hybridizations, using labeled, gene specific probes. Additionally, SB1 and SB2 specific antibodies will be generated and used to ascertain which microtubule arrays contain these tubulins. The trans-acting factors regulating the transcription of the SB1 and SB2 tubulin genes in soybean internodal tissues will be identified by means of footprinting and gel retardation assays. These DNA binding regulatory proteins will be isolated by affinity chromatography and the nature of their interaction with SB1 and SB2 promoter elements will be studied. Antibodies raised to these DNA binding proteins will be used to isolate cDNAs encoding them from a lambda gt11 expression library. The cDNAs will be used as probes to examine the regulation of expression of the genes encoding these DNA binding proteins. %%% In plants microtubules are an important subcellular component involved in determining how cells expand and as a consequence, how tissues grow. This study will elucidate how the expression of a microtubule protein is expressed during plant growth and in response to light.\n",

      "a9004707 MCB $427905 The overall goal of this proposal is to determine the mechanism by which the amino acid sequence of a protein directs the rapid and efficient folding to the native conformation. The approach is to use site-directed mutagenesis to identify sidechains which play key roles in folding. Those that have such roles will, when replaced, have discernable effects on the equilibrium and kinetic properties of folding. The protein to be studied is dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) from Escherchia coli. DHFR is a relatively small monomeric protein which has no disulfide bonds or prosthetic groups and for which a high resolution X-ray structure exists. A combination of absorbance, fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopies have been used to establish a folding model for DHFR. This model postulates the existence of a number of transient folding intermediates whose structures and energetics will be studied. The rate limiting steps in folding which immediately precede the native conformation will also be subjects for further investigation. The information obtained from these studies will enhance the possibility of predicting the tertiary structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence, advance our understanding of the molecular defects in genetically transmitted diseases, and improve our ability to alter enzymes to improve catalytic properties.\n",
      "a9004708 MCB $218900 Spontaneous mutation in Drosophila melanogaster are frequently caused by insertions of retrotransposons. Mutant phenotypes result from insertions into both coding and noncoding regions, and the mutagenic effects caused by insertions into coding and noncoding regions are not well understood. Some phenotypes resulting from retrotransposoninsertions can be reversed by extrangenic suppressor and intragenic reversion mutations. The long term objective of this study is to understand how these mobile elements disrupt the expression of nearby genes and to elucidate the role of suppressors in modulating the mutagenic activity of retrotransposons. A suppressible mutation caused by insertion of the 412 element into the vermilion (v) gene of Drosophila is being investigated. In this case, the 412 element inserted into the 5' untranslated region of the first exon, and transposable element sequences are almost entirely eliminated from the mature RNA by splicing at sites near the ends of 412. Mutations at suppressor of sable (su(s)) cause increased accumulation of nearly wild-type sized v transcripts. One objective of this proposal is to investigate the mechanism of suppression. The proposed experiments will define whether su(s) mutations affect transcription, RNA stability or splicing. Other experiments will indicate whether specific 412 sequences interfere with v RNA accumulation and are required for the response to su(s) mutations or whether interference is due to the position of the 412 insertion. A second objective is to investigate the mechanism of intragenic reversion. In one v revertant, a second retrotransposon inserted into one end of the 412 element, altering the splicing pattern. The proposed experiments will ascertain whether the secondary insertion significantly improves the rate of splicing to remove transposon sequences. If so, the effect of changes in splice sites on the response to su(s) mutations will be determined. These goals will be accomplished by examining levels of precursor and mature v RNA produced by in vitro generated variants of the mutant and revertant alleles after transformation into the Drosophila germ line.***\n",
      "a9004709 CMS $49997 The project will utilize the loss estimation procedures developed in a previous work in which a Damage Assessment Handbook was also generated. These methodology will be applied to estimate the damages produced by two consecutive natural disasters occurred some months ago, Hurricane Hugo and the Loma Prieta earthquake. These two events of a quite different physical nature, will be the test cases providing a unique opportunity for determining the extent and magnitude of economic dislocations and direct losses produced by each of them. The comparison between these two cases will also validate the effectiveness of the new damage assessment procedure as applied to any natural hazard. Five issues will be addressed: a) what procedures did agencies follow to estimate direct damages, and what is the quality of the data used; b) using the Damage Assessment Handbook, what were the direct damages and how sizeable were the economic dislocations; c) what were the measures taken to soften the impact of the economic dislocations; d) what was the impact on historical sites and cultural patrimony; and e) what accounting stance (local, state or national) was used. The results of this work will benefit the research community, post-audit process, the insurance and construction industries, the agencies, planners and administrators.\n",

      "a9004712 EAR $37440 Recently it has become clear from a variety of field observations that downstream size decrease in aggrading river systems is caused in large part by selective deposition of coarse clasts. However, sorting by selective deposition has never been studied systematically under controlled conditions. The absence of a set of reference data on downstream sorting is even more striking in light of the number of theories that have been advanced recently to explain it. The main goal of the proposed project is to carry out a series of basic experiments on selective transport and deposition in poorly sorted gravelly sediments. Most of the experiments will be conducted in a large channel at the St. Anthony Falls Hydraulic Laboratory. There we will produce deposits from a poorly sorted sand-gravel mix over a distance of about 50 m. The main variables will be rate of sediment feed (and hence deposition), and channel form (straight, weakly sinuous, braided). In addition we will make detailed measurements of sediment transport and surface texture in a smaller flume at Johns Hopkins University. These data will be used to develop surface-based transport formulas that will be used in modeling the sorting observed in the large flume.\n",
      "a9004719 MCB $288784 The distribution of mitochondria and other subcellular organelles during cell division is an essential process for the proliferation of eukaryotic cells, yet the mechanisms facilitating and controlling this process are unknown. The goal of this study is to analyze the molecular basis for the distribution of mitochondria during mitosis. A primary aim is to identify proteins and subcellular structures which mediate this transport process. A second goal is to characterize the specific roles of these components in intracellular mitochondrial movements. A long-term objective is to understand how the distribution of mitochondria and other organelles is coordinated with other essential events of the cell division cycle. Mechanisms that distribute mitochondria during mitosis will be studied using a combined biochemical and genetic approach. This approach will focus on a characterization of mutant cells of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae which are defective in the segreation of mitochondria. These mutants, which were isolated previously, first will be analyzed morphologically to examine the effect of the mutations on cellular structures and events of the cell cycle. The mutants will be used next to clone genes that encode components which facilitate mitochondrial distribution, and information from gene analysis will guide the production of antisera against the gene products. These antibodies will be used to identify and localize the proteins, and to examine changes in cellular distribution of the proteins during the cell cycle. Binding studies will be employed to characterize the interaction of these MDM (mitochondrial distribution and morphology) proteins with mitochondria or other subcellular structures. In a latter stage on the investigation, additional components that interact with MDM proteins will be identified by both biochemical and genetic approaches, and the function of these new components will be examined. Additionally, proteins that mediate mitochondrial movement will be investigated in cells that divide by a different mitotic pattern, fission. These studies of mitochondiral movement should reveal new details of cellular organization and cell division, and provide a foundation for understanding the changes in cellular structure that accompany differentiation.\n",
      "a9004727 CCR $226032 The objectives of this research are to: 1. Design and analyze algorithms with fast average-case time, simultaneously obtaining speed, simpler algorithms, and developing an analysis of algorithms which matches practice better than the usual emphasis on worst-case time. Both fine-grained shared memory, and medium-grained distributed memory, machines will be considered. This includes work on modeling and implementing algorithms with a range of local/global tradeoffs, so that such algorithms can be ported to a variety of machines and be easily optimized on each. 2. Determine relationships among various abstract models of concurrent writes, emphasizing models with potential optical implementations. 3. Develop reductions among problems, and develop parallel algorithms in terms of a few standard problems, to simplify portability among architectures. 4. Develop a distributed-memory machine which matches the performance of shared-memory machines on a variety of geometrical problems.\n",
      "a9004735 IBN $200826 Dr.Lambert and Dr.Goode will study a block to polyspermy in the Ascidian egg. According to their model, the sperm bind to glycosides on the vitelline coat of the egg. An increase in the number of sperm binding to the vitelline coat is followed by a rapid decline. This decline in binding helps insure that only a single sperm enters the egg. Sperm binding is inhibited by the Na+-dependent release of a glycosidase that modifies the vitelline coat sperm receptors. They hypothesize that the glycosidase is initially linked to the egg membrane and is rapidly discharged at fertilization. The fact that detergents and Phospholipase C can free the enzyme from the unfertilized egg suggest that the enzyme is linked to a membrane phospholipid. Their model includes linkage of the glycosidase to a phosphatidylcholine and the Na+-dependent activation of a phospholipase that causes enzyme release. The glycosidase and phospholipase will be isolated and extensively characterized. Antibodies will be prepared to both proteins for ultrastructural enzyme localization. The mechanism of release will be probed through the use of phospholipase agonists and antagonists and also through the direct measurement of phospholipase activity in unfertilized and fertilized eggs. The role of G proteins and ions in Ascidian egg activation will also be probed. %%% Although millions of sperm are produced for each egg, if more than a single sperm enters the egg,cleavage is grossly abnormal and death is inevitable. As a consequence, blocking the entry of additional sperm is of critical importance to fertility. Dr.Lambert and Dr. Goode will further the understanding of this phenomenon by studying the molecular details of sperm entry and blocking in the Ascidian system.\n",
      "a9004745 EAR $28800 Early to Late Silurian limestones from the Heceta Formation record the earliest occurrence of widespread carbonate deposition in the region and represent the earliest foundation for shallow water platform development within the arc. The excellent preservation of shallow to deep subtidal deposits within the Alexander arc contrasts with the poor preservation of many marine sediments that originated within other island arcs. Hence, these limestones provide important insights into the styles, processes and bathymetry of carbonate deposition in tectonically active areas. Although previously described as having a shallow marine origin, the limestones from the Heceta Formation can be differentiated into shallow water platform, platform margin, and slope facies. Renewal support will enable PI to pursue topics that relate to: (1) the dynamics of reef sedimentation and carbonate platform development within the Alexander arc; (2) physical and biologic controls on stromatolite distribution within the arc; and (3) regional biogeographic correlations. The proposed research will involve field work and laboratory analyses during a two-year period and will generate a model for carbonate platform and reef evolution within a tectonic framework. Results of the proposed research will refine our understanding of Silurian reef evolution and decline in different tectonic settings, factors affecting Phanerozoic stromatolite development, and the paleogeography of the Alexander terrane.\n",
      "a9004746 MCB $567000 This research program is focused on three inter-related questions concerning regulation of muscle contraction: the molecular basis for calcium-dependent control by myosin, the role of protein phosphorylation and filament architecture in regulating long-lasting contractions, and the structure and dynamics of the calcium-pumping protein assembly in the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane. In each case, the goal is to relate the detailed structure and properties of individual protein molecules to the architecture and dynamics of the native protein assemblies in muscle. Drs. Vibert and Cohen have established that certain invertebrate muscles are especially suitable for these investigations, and that their structural and regulatory properties are of general significance for contraction in many muscle types, including those of vertebrates. In the next phase of this program, application of advanced methods of electron microscopy - especially cryo-electron microscopy of vitrified samples - should provide images of higher resolution and fidelity than have been produced in the past. Coupled with the use of proteins altered by site-directed mutagenesis, and of specific antibodies, these structural approaches should allow them to integrate findings at the molecular level into a picture of regulation in whole muscle. Knowledge of the structure and switching of the protein assemblies that regulate muscle contraction involves understanding inter-related control systems at a higher level of organization than any yet achieved.\n",
      "a9004747 EAR $37000 This study addresses the role of mafic and intermediate- composition magmas in the genesis of rhyolites at the Tomochic volcanic center (TVC), where the stratigraphic section is the most complete and where the history of volcanism is best documented among known eruptive centers in the Sierra Madre Occidental. Recent field and chronologic work at the TVC has indicated that two distinct lithologies, porphyritic two-pyroxene andesite and crystal-poor basaltic andesite, were important components of the magma systems that fed large-volume rhyolite ash-flow eruptions. A genetic relationship between these lithologies and the rhyolites is allowed, but is poorly constrained, by available data. The principal goal of this study will be to evaluate that relationship further, via: (a)comparison and modeling of mineralogic, isotopic (Sr, Nd), and geochemical variations among all rock types, and (b) petrologic study of hybrid post-collapse lavas, to characterize the deep, mafic parts of the reservoir beneath the Las Varas caldera, for comparison with extruded basaltic andesite. Results will constrain model pertaining to the genesis of rhyolites, and of associated, more mafic magmas, in what is considered the world's largest \"rhyolite-dominated\"volcanic field. Results will also be important to models linking style of volcanism with tectonic regime, and to our understanding of processes associated with the evolution of large-volume subcaldera reservoirs.\n",
      "a9004748 DMS $451000 This project covers a wide range of topics in algebraic and geometric topology. More specifically, the researchers study the following: (a) Combinatorial and geometric properties of various classes of discrete groups, including finitely presented infinite simple groups, groups presented by a rewriting system, groups presented by a triangle of groups, and the automorphism group of a free or free-by-finite group; (b) laminations in 3-manifolds; (c) equivariant and controlled topology, including the equivariant topology of locally linearizable actions and the topological equivalence of linear representations. Topology addresses geometric properties which do not depend in an essential way on distances or angles. It nevertheless attempts to find ways to compare topological objects and to reduce their study to computations in many cases. The instant project is engaged in different aspects of this multifarious effort.\n",
      "a9004750 EAR $158810 This research is to do seismological studies of the thermal regime and dynamics of mid-ocean ridges and oceanic lithosphere and asthenosphere. The state of stress will be investigated by means of source mechanisms of earthquakes. Lateral heterogeneity of oceanic structure will be determined from studies of S, SS, and P-wave travel times. The objectives are to understand the relation of earthquake seismicity and source characteristics to the thermal and mechanical structure of oceanic lithosphere, to determine the 3-D seismic structure of the lithosphere and asthenosphere beneath the oceans, and to relate both types of observations to specific models for the processes of seafloor spreading and mantle convection.\n",
      "a9004751 EAR $1609 Mid-Ordovician/Early Silurian land plant spores can contribute to the resolution of two important problems. Land plant spores provide the only entrance into terrestrial and fresh H2O environments in this interval of Phanerozoic time. The research described in this proposal is the first to attempt to establish a Late Ordovician/Early Silurian nonmarine biostratigraphy and phytogeography. Throughout the post-Silurian Phanerozoic, land plant spores/pollen have proved vital in stratigraphic zonation of nonmarine and shallow-water, nearshore marine rocks. Only local attempts have been made to extend spore biostratigraphy into the Late Silurian, and none effectively into the pre-Late Silurian. It now appears possible to establish a continuous biostratigraphy for shallow-water nearshore marine and nonmarine rocks from the mid-Ordovician to the Devonian. This will be the first zonation possible for nonmarine rocks; it will also provide the only precise means of correlating shallow-water, nearshore, Late Ordovician-Silurian strata since marine invertebrates/organic microfossils are absent or not presently biostratigraphically useful in the nearshore facies. Equally important is the fact that the spore-producing plants represent a hitherto unknown group of land plants that placed an important source of vegetation into continental habitats well before the traditional Early Devonian benchmark commonly considered to mark the major, initial radiation of the tracheophytes.\n",
      "a9004752 MCB $120000 This proposal aims to characterize the constitutive isoform of nitrate reductase that is present in soybeans and uses either NADH or NADPH as reductant. Monoclonal antibodies will be generated and used to study epitopes of this isoform and also used to purify large quantities of this isoform by immunoaffinity chromatography. The protein will then be characterized biochemically, and a cDNA clone will be prepared by screening a lambda gt11 library. Nitrogen is the mineral nutrient that most often limits the growth of agricultural crops. In well aerated soils, fertilizer nitrogen is mostly present in the form of nitrate, which the plants must internally convert to ammonia before the nitrogen can be used to produce the compounds that make up plant proteins. The enzyme nitrate reductase initiates this conversion, and in soybean there are three different forms of the enzyme present. The new work to be carried out in Dr. John Smarrelli's laboratory provides fundamental information about the properties of one specific form of this enzyme. Successful completion of this approach can be expected to provide insights that will ultimately assist in increasing the efficiency of the process of nitrate utiliztion by plants.\n",
      "a9004756 EAR $118570 Recently it has become clear from a variety of field observations that downstream size decrease in aggrading river systems is caused in large part by selective deposition of coarse clasts. However, sorting by selective deposition has never been studied systematically under controlled conditions. The absence of a set of reference data on downstream sorting is even more striking in light of the number of theories that have been advanced recently to explain it. The main goal of the proposed project is to carry out a series of basic experiments on selective transport and deposition in poorly sorted gravelly sediments. Most of the experiments will be conducted in a large channel at the St. Anthony Falls Hydraulic Laboratory. There we will produce deposits from a poorly sorted sand-gravel mix over a distance of about 50 m. The main variables will be rate of sediment feed (and hence deposition), and channel form (straight, weakly sinuous, braided). In addition we will make detailed measurements of sediment transport and surface texture in a smaller flume at Johns Hopkins University. These data will be used to develop surface-based transport formulas that will be used in modeling the sorting observed in the large flume.\n",

      "a9004762 EAR $82800 Will generate a new set of detailed stable isotopic, structural, petrochemical, and petrographic data in order to characterize as quantitatively as possible, the fluid flow and mass transfer/alteration, and their timing in relation to the cooling history of the Cuillin Complex. It is now increasingly accepted in the Cuillin Complex consists of multiple concentric intrusions separated by significant time gaps. The resulting complex thermal history and recent isotopic studies (Farver and Giletti, 1989; Ito et al., 1986) suggest the occurrence of two (or more) phases of fluid flow. Studies of large intrusions elsewhere (e.g., Bird et al., 1986, 1988) have documented the importance of fluid flow through fractures leading to hydrothermal alteration of the plutons. Forester and Taylor (1977) suggested an extensive, penetrative style of fluid flow in the Cuillin Complex, but the results of Ito et al. (1986) suggest that fractures may have been important in channeling the fluid flow within the complex. The Cuillin Complex, with its exceptional exposure and a significant body of accumulated high quality data, is an ideal setting in which to clarify the relationships among the nature of hydrothermal alteration, fluid flow, mass transfer, and their timing in relation to the cooling history.\n",
      "a9004763 IBN $239000 The overall goal of this research is to identify factors involved in blue-light induced transcription of proteins in higher plants. There are two basic classes of transcription factors, core factors and regulatory factors. Core factors allow for low level, constitutive expression. Their presence or activity is not regulated and they function for many genes. Regulatory factors are not always active and affect the rate of Pisum sativum (pea) and Arabidopsis thaliani to identify the regulatory factors that effect blue-light transcription of a pigment-binding protein found in plants. Blue light represents a regulatory signal for many events in growth and development. Examples of these events are found in all the kingdoms and range from bacterial motion to alleviation of winter depression in humans. The basic biochemical mechanism by which blue light is perceived and transduced into a signal useful for the cell is probably very ancient. Indeed, as light represents one of the oldest environmental cues, it may be that blue-light regulation is the oldest signal. Understanding this ancient mechanism will provide insight into how cells interpret many extracellular signals.\n",
      "a9004775 IBN $180000 gonadal (gdl) is a gene that is differentially expressed in the male and female germ lines of Drosophila. This proposal describes experiments that address gdl function in the germ line, sex- specific expression of the gdl gene products, and complex regulation of the gene during gametogenesis. The specific goals of the research are summarized as follows. First, complementing genetic techniques will be used to isolate gdl mutant alleles. The gdl mutants will then be characterized as to specific phenotype, with the overall objective being to determine the role gdl plays in the male and/or female germ line. Second, Dr. Schulz will generate antibodies directed against gdl proteins so as to facilitate the characterization of the gene products. The objective is to determine whether the proteins have common or different functions during spermatogenesis and oogenesis. Third, he will study gdl expression in mutations affecting germ cell differentiation. These studies may identify genes that regulate gdl and should provide additional information on gene expression in the early germ line. Additionally, gdl may serve as a sensitive sex specific differentiation marker during gametogenesis. Overall, the extensive analysis of the gdl gene should enhance the current understanding of germ cell differentiation in Drosophila.\n",
      "a9004777 EAR $95889 Knowledge of the posotion of the supercontinent of Laurentia with respect to Gondwana and peri-Gondwanide terranes, such as Armorica, Iberia and Avalonia, is of paramount importance for the proper understanding and quantification of geodynamic events during the Paleozoic. Unfortunately, the paleomagnetic database for the Silurian-Devonian of continents once part of Gondwana is incomplete and provides few constraints on paleogeographic models. The result has been the appearance of several controversial paleogeographic models with very different interpretations for this period. One means of constraining or testing such reconstructions is through comparison with well interpreted and robust biogeographic patterns. One major group of marine invertebrates, the nautiloid cephalopods, is particularly well suited to this task. A significant portion of nautiloid evolution occurred during the Silurian-Devonian, the biogeographic database is large and can be made much better with reasonable effort, analytical techniques are available to provide patterns of exceptional quality, and the spatial distributions of nautiloid cephalopods are now known to have been particularly well controlled by barriers to dispersal of the magnitude easily recognized with proper methods.\n",

This project addresses the Septentrional fault zone in the Dominican Republic which is the active, on shore extension of the North American- Caribbean plate boundary. The work will focus on fault trenching at three Quaternary fault scarps combined with radiocarbon age dating. These data are expected to date the ages of past earthquakes along the fault and directly determine geologic slip rates. These results can be used to test conflicting plate motion models and can be integrated into ongoing marine geophysical survey and GPS experiments along the plate boundary.\n",
      "a9004783 EAR $91100 The processes that have initiated and terminated shallow-water carbonate platforms throughout Phanerozoic time are a focus of the Global Sedimentary Geology Project. Exposures of an isolated Triassic platform in Guizhou Province, PRC, provide an excellent opportunity to document its birth and death, its internal sedimentary and diagenetic facies patterns, and the transitions into the surrounding deeper water deposits. Other objectives of the field stratigraphic study include documenting the transition from Permian to Triassic, apparently conformable but with a major reduction in platform area, and applying concepts of sequence stratigraphy and cycle analysis to understanding the history of the platform. Fluid inclusions and conodont coloration will be used to establish the post-Triassic thermal history of this area and to evaluate possible trends in heating which may indicate the most favorable areas for hydrocarbon preservation. Conodonts may help improve intercontinental correlations, particularly at the Permo- Triassic boundary.\n",
      "a9004789 DEB $73587 Just prior to and immediately after the mass extinctions used to mark the end of the Cretaceous eutherian (placental) mammals underwent a major evolutionary radiation. Systematic analyses of these mammals, based on their gross dental morphology (the primary suite of characters available for analysis), have resulted in neither full clarification of their phylogenetic interrelationships nor in understanding of the adaptive (functional) differences that contributed to the radiation. Learning and applying the techniques involved in analysis of the microstructure of mammalian enamel will provide an additional suite of characters that can be used to address these problems and research techniques that can be passed on to graduate students who are faced with similar problems in their research. A sabbatical leave during the academic year 1990-1991 and an invitation to work in the laboratory of Professor Dr. Wighart von Koenigswald, Director of the Palaontologisches Institut der Universitat Bonn (BRD). will provide a new research environment, time to learn new research techniques and the opportunity to take a fresh approach to research on the patterns and causal factors of the early radiation of eutherian mammals.\n",
      "a9004790 EAR $45000 This project will investigate juvenile glassy tephra from the nuee-ardente deposits produced the cataclysmic eruptions on Montagne Pelee in 1902, as a basis for interpretation of the role of hydrovolcanism in the eruption dynamics of this cycle of activity. The research is undertaken specifically to provide sharper insights into the physical processes responsible for such large and devastating explosive eruptions. Electron microprobe (EMP), scanning electron microscope (SEM), image analysis, and size distribution analysis will be the main techniques used to investigate tephra deposits left by the passage of successive nuees ardentes or sediment gravity flows in the vicinity of St. Pierre, Martinique. Internal and surficial textural information observed on juvenile vitric fragments from the nuee ardente deposits will shed light on (1) processes of magma vesiculavesiculation and fragmentamentation as a result of sion of juvenile magmatic volatiles; (2) the role and timing of hydromagmatism during the eruption; (3) the genesis of nuee ardentes; and (4) the mechanics of particle-particle interaction during transtransport and deposition of nuee-ardente tephra. Grain size distribution analysis using the new model of sequential fragmentation and transport will allow the identification of maturity of fragmentation and transportation processes to be evaluated for various parts of the nuees at various distances from the source. This information should be extremely useful in the evaluation of volcanic hazards at volcanoes with a history of large expolosions such as those of Montagne Pelee.\n",
      "a9004792 MCB $100000 Photosynthetic bacteria use a single branched pathway to synthesize all four tetrapyrrole endproducts: heme, bacteriochlorophyll, vitamin B-12, and siroheme. What makes this branched pathway so interesting is that the four products play such diverse roles in cellular metabolism and are required in vastly different amounts. The ultimate aim of this research is to understand how the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus coordinates the synthesis of the four tetrapyrrole products. Recent evidence suggests that the PufQ protein binds to some tetrapyrrole intermediate and is involved in its conversion to bacteriochlorophyll. Synthesis of bacteriochlorophyll is therefore regulated by the amount of PufQ protein present in the cell. The role of carrier proteins such as PufQ in the regulation of the common tetrapyrrole pathway that leads to heme and bacteriochlorophyll is being determined. When coproporphyrin is excreted from R. capsulatus it is complexed with a 32kDa protein which is too large to be PufQ. This protein is being partially sequenced, the gene cloned using oligonucleotide probes, and a mutant constructed that lacks the protein. The phenotype of this mutant allows for a determination of whether this protein is required for heme synthesis, bacteriochlorophyll synthesis, or both. Other hem mutants are being isolated so that it can be determined which tetrapyrrole intermediate is the first to bind a carrier protein. It can be argued that the biosynthetic pathway leading to the production of tetrapyrroles such as chlorophyll and heme is one of the most important pathways in nature. Currently, very little is known about how this complex pathway is regulated. The photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus provides an ideal model system, in that it synthesizes all four tetrapyrrole endproducts and is amenable to study both genetically and biochemically. This research aims at an understanding of how an adequate yet balanced supply of these compounds is ensured. //\n",
      "a9004795 EAR $68700 An integrated field and laboratory investigation is planned of garnet peridotites and eclogites in the Czech portion of the Bohemian Massif, which is the easternmost extent of the Variscan Orogen in Europe. These high-pressure rocks occur in sequence of continental crustal rocks in the Moldanubian Zone, which is the most internal and highly metamorphosed tectonostratigraphic unit of the Variscan Orogen. Previous studies have demonstrated: 1) the occurrence of two types of garnet peridotites, which exhibit different modes of origin, T-p histories, and cooling rates, and 2) a mantle origin for Group A eclogite lenses in peridotites, which formed by high-pressure crystal accumulation and were carried into the crust by enclosing peridotites that were tectonically emplaced during the Variscan Orogeny. Further isotopic investigations will be performed on selected peridotite and ecologite samples that have already been characterized petrologically, and integrated field, petrologic, geochemical, and isotopic studies will be made of additional peridotite bodies and Group B eclogite lenses in gneisses. The results should provide a basis for establishing the timing and nature of high-pressure metamorphism in this portion of the Variscan belt, an improve our understanding of the complexities involved in the interaction of mantle and crust during orogenesis.\n",

      "a9004806 IBN $165793 Dr. Vom Saal will use two research strategies to examine the hypothesis that the levels of sex steroids to which male mice (Mus musculus domesticus) are exposed during fetal life play a major role in influencing aging, particularly of the reproductive system. The first approach involves using a naturally-occurring phenomenon, the intrauterine position phenomenon. Males occupying different intrauterine positions are naturally exposed to different endogenous blood steroid levels during fetal life due to being randomly positioned in utero between 2 male fetuses (these males have elevated serum levels of testosterone) or between 2 female fetuses (these males have elevated serum levels of estradiol). The intrauterine position of males will be identified at cesarean delivery, and they will be raised for examination during later life. The second approach will involve treating pregnant females with either estradiol or testosterone to slightly increase serum concentrations of these steroids during sexual differentiation in all male fetuses of treated mothers. He will examine lifespan, the incidence of tumors in old age, fertility (the capacity to successfully mate with females and sire young), and functioning of the prostate and seminal vesicles (as assessed by enzyme activity and capacity to bind hormones) during aging in male mice. During the fetal period of differentiation of the brain and reproductive system, individuals in all mammalian species may be exposed to markedly different levels of sex steroid hormones due to a variety of reasons. While it is known that individual differences in many characteristics relating to reproduction in young-adult animals are determined by levels of sex hormones during fetal life, no one has examined whether lifespan of the pattern of reproductive aging in males might be predicted by fetal sex hormone levels. In most mammalian species, including man, there are a few aged males who retain the capacity to reproduce, while the majority of males become reproductively inactive in old age. The proposed experiments should provide important information concerning why such dramatic differences in reproductive capacity and lifespan are observed between individual males.\n",
      "a9004812 EAR $30000 We propose to advance the Baikal project by concentrating on characterization of the 150 samples currently in hand. No travel to the USSR is planned under the aegis of 1990-91 funding. If results of our analytical work warrant additional field studies and collecting, we will formulate a new proposal based on these results. The SMU portion of the project will focus on obtaining K-Ar dates, and on mineral chemistry. The new dates are essential, because we intend to evaluate the geochemical variations among lavas in a temporal-spatial framework. We have found the Soviet dates to be completely unreliable. I will contract for approximately 20 dates on whole-rock basalt samples. As the whole-rock geochemistry and isotopic analyses will be done at Washington University, it is appropriate that the mineral chemistry work be done at SMU. I will perform microprobe analyses of phenocrysts, xenocrysts, and xenoliths. The budget includes funds for travel to St. Louis in order to allow us to get together after the sample characterization phase, integrate our data, and arrive at interpretations of the results. Dr. Sergey Rasskazov, with whom we are collaborating, has been invited to spend a month in the laboratories of Luhr and Bowring during late 1990 in order to maintain project momentum and facilitate cooperation.\n",
      "a9004813 EAR $134700 The main objectives of this project are: (1) to understand the relationship among various properties of pyrite (e.g. reflectivity, hardness, anisotropy, lattice cells, sulfur deficiency, conductivity, surface reactivity, 34S), the specific pathways of pyrite formation (e.g. replacement of stable or metastable iron monosulfide, direct precipitation from hydrothermal fluids), and the mechanisms of polysulfide generation (e.g. H2 diffusion, H2S - SO42-reaction) that are involved in the formation of hydrothermal pyrites, and (2) to determine the kinetic and the equilibrium sulfur isotopic fractionation factors between pyrite and various aqueous sulfur species. These objectives will be pursued by a variety of hydrothermal experiments to synthesize iron disulfide minerals at 200oC - 350oC, by mineralogical, chemical, electrochemical and sulfur isotopic investigations of the experimental run products. The results from this project may provide a set of mineralogical and isotopic indicators of geochemical processes and environments of ore formation, and of chemical and isotopic compositions of hydrothermal fluids as well as information useful for the development of pyrite as a semiconductor.\n",

      "a9004824 EAR $97435 Models of the long-term, global carbon cycle have lacked a geographic dimension; model input and output have been restricted to global-mean values. Climate change on million-year time scales can be driven by redistribution of the continents and their weathering lithologies (as this affects atmospheric pCO2). This project will explore the nature of Phanerozoic climate change by performing several new climate simulations. Runs at different pCO2's for the same time periods will elucidate the relationship between global temperature and runoff (the two most important variables affecting chemical weathering rates and thus pCO2). These climate variables will then be used in calculations of global weathering rates, using paleogeologic maps prepared during our previous research. In addition, two other important factors, topography (relief) and biological enhancement of chemical weathering rates, will be assessed, using present-day observations of their affect on soil and stream chemistry, and by assembling and reconstructing paleophytogeographies. The goal of this research is to create a realistic, coupled model of climate and biogeochemical cycles that can be used to investigate the geographic and temporal variability of Phanerozoic climate.\n",
      "a9004836 DMS $43150 The principal investigator will continue his study of the geometry of the Yang-Mills moduli space. This will include an analysis of the semiclassical measure on moduli space with fermions added, and Donaldson invariants in terms of differential forms. He will also investigate a general approach to establishing the existence of non-minimal Yang-Mills fields on 4- manifolds with symmetry. In the early 1980s S.K.Donaldson showed the intimate connection between solutions of the Yang-Mills equations and differentiable structures on four-dimensional space. This discovery meant that two four-dimensional space-times could be topologically the same (have the same shape) but be differentiably distinct. No experiments have been devised to discover which of these differentiable structures describes our space-time. The principal investigator will continue his analysis of the ramifications of Donaldson's discoveries.\n",
      "a9004839 MCB $286000 The research program is designed to explore how the properties of genes and the stability of regions within genes are influenced by neighboring DNA sequences. Bacterial intradiol dioxygenase genes, the subjects of the investigation, share common ancestry and have undergone numerous rearrangements during their evolutionary divergence. Rearrangements might be expected to lead to the physical separation of independently transcribed genes, but the chromosomal position of divergent oxygenase genes has been conserved within different supraoperonic clusters. Selective forces favoring the clustering of genes will be explored by examining the physiological and genetic consequences of directed transposition of oxygenase genes from one cluster to another. Transposition can lead to genetic instability, and a possible source of instability is sequence-directed mutation, a process that can lead to deletions between regions of DNA sequence repetition. The extent to which sequence-directed mutations occur will be explored by comparison of the DNA sequences of genes that have undergone spontaneous mutation either in their normal location or after transposition to a different cluster. Processes that lead to sequence-directed mutation also might contribute to genetic repair, and this possibility will be explored by analysis of DNA sequence of mutations that revert readily. Enzymatic activation of oxygen is a fundamental biological process, and the genetic analysis of oxygenases will increase our understanding of biochemical steps that direct the assimilation of molecular oxygen into organic substrates. We plan to isolate mutant oxygenases that are functional but altered in substrate specificity or in catalytic efficiency,. Analysis of these proteins is likely to provide novel insight into interactions between oxygenases and their substrates.\n",

Each vent was investigated in detail with regard to the spatial abundance of crustal and mantle xenoliths, and attempts were made to quantify the relative abundances of xenolith types in outcrop based on hand-sample observations. Aranda-Gomez will continue with this statistical work in a petrographic study at the Mexican National University using thin sections from small fragments of 50-60 representative crustal xenoliths.

      "a9004841 DEB $229999 Deadly Toxic yeasts secrete proteins that are toxic to other yeasts. The P.I.s interested in evaluating the role of toxic yeasts in the organization of natural communities of yeasts species. The investigators past work has shown that these yeasts are relatively common in nature with at least one species present in all communities examined (i.e. the distinct yeasts communities associated with stem necroses of various cacti, slime fluxes of trees and decaying tissue of fruits). The P.I.'s will investigate two different yeasts, Pichia Kluyveri and P. thermotolerans, that occur in rotting fruits and decaying stems of cactus respectively. The system of Toxic P. Kluveri is especially interesting since it has a very flexible genetic system that displays species specific killing genotypes. In order to understand and link the knowledge on both the genetics and ecology the investigators will do an in depth ecological survey that assays genotypes of P. Kluyveri in conjunction with he resistance phenotypes of associated yeast species. This work, in parallel with detailed laboratory genetic analysis and field/laboratory experiments designed to reveal the adaptive significance of specific killer genotypes should allow the evaluation of the importance of toxin production to the organization of the community. The proposed work with P. thermotoloerans will provide comparative information from a relative different system; an system that is restricted terms of hosts (saguaro cactus) and geography (Sonoran Desert). The overall goal is to understand the fundamental reasons for community structure. Deadly toxins in yeasts represent an opportunity to study a case where the mechanism of interference competition is clear and unambiguous.\n",
      "a9004842 EAR $95000 An experimental investigation of amphibole decomposition reaction rates is proposed which should yield estimates of magma ascent rates for many andesite, dacite and rhyolite magmas. Ascent rate estimates are used in conjunction with experimentally determined pre-eruption magma chamber conditions (P,T, fH2O)) to constrain models of eruption dynamics. Reactions to be studied are (1) decomposition of amphibole by reaction with melt to form pyroxenes, plagioclase, Fe-Ti oxides and a more evolved melt, and (2) associated plagioclase crystallization. Preliminary studies of natural tephra and dome rock samples indicate that these reactions have proceeded to different degrees in Mount St. Helens and long Valley caldera eruption products. The extent of reaction is indicated by measurements of the widths of amphibole breakdown rims, and by changes in plagioclase and melt composition. The extent of reaction is primarily a function of decompression (decreasing fH2O) at roughly constant temperature, judging from oxide geothermometry of recent Mount St. Helens dacite eruption products (1980-1986). Extent of reaction, as measured by amphibole breakdown rim width and plagioclase crystallization, will be experimentally calibrated as a function of decompression rate. Primary objectives of the research are (1) to estimate magma ascent rates for well-studied tephra and dome eruptions of Mount St. Helens and Long Valley caldera, and (2) to compare the ascent rate estimates with those derived from (a) crystal size distribution analysis and (b) earthquake focus migration analysis.\n",
      "a9004843 EAR $159166 Debris flows pose a hazard to lives and structures in mountain communities throughout the world. Motivated by the need to enhance prediction and mitigation, research projects, particularly in the U.S. and Japan, have produced wealth of information on initiation and dynamics of debris flows. By comparison, little research has been devoted to understanding debris flows in the environment where their hazard potential is most serious: i.e., on debris-flow fans. Debris-flow fans form a significant portion of the landscape and aside from concerns about hazards, the dearth of rigorous studies of the processes forming debris-flow fans represents a basic lack of scientific knowledge about a major landform of Earth's surface. The proposed research will address the mechanics of formation of debris-flow fans. The study complements on-going debris-flow monitoring programs in this country and in East Asia in that we will develop a methodology for interpreting the vast amounts of information on debris flows and fan formation stored in the debris-flow deposits themselves. Our approach considers the processes of, and controls on, debris-flow initiation, conveyance, and interaction with the channels of the fan surface, starting with the lithologic and climatic conditions in the source area and their influence on flow mobility, volume, and frequency of occurrence. The approach is a general one, applicable in a range of environments, and not limited to the specific conditions in the chosen field study site: Owens Valley, CA. The model will be built around an rheological description of debris-flow dynamics and will be based on field and laboratory data.\n",
      "a9004860 MCB $175000 This laboratory uses an unusual in vivo ultrastructural approach, the \"Miller chromatin spreading technique,\" to visualize transcriptionally active genes in the electron microscope and to analyze the co-transcriptional RNA processing events on nascent pre-mRNA transcripts, including ribonucleoprotein (RNP) formation, splice site selection, constitutive splicing, and alternative splicing. In order to extend observations from the level of ultrastructural phenomenology to biochemical identification of specific proteins, there is a need to be able to identify the proteins at specific sites on the transcripts and in specific structures. The technique of immuno-electron microscopy would allow this analysis, but has not yet been perfected for use on Miller chromatin spreads. The proposed project will take a systematic and logical approach to the development of such a technique. Some of the desired monoclonal antibodies are already in hand, which will be used in conjunction with colloidal gold markers for EM visualization.Immediate applications of such a technique include localization on nascent RNA of specific snRNPs, specific hnRNP proteins, general splicing factors, and proteins implicated in splicing regulation. The technique would be more generally useful, however, and could be used to localize proteins involved in chromatin structure, replication, transcription regulation, attenuation, and polyadenylation to specific sites or structures on the genetic material. The development of this technique would thus make possible a deeper understanding of how proteins interact with DNA and RNA to effect and regulate gene expression.\n",
      "a9004862 EAR $400000 This award provides matching funds that will be applied toward the purchase of a new generation, sensitive, high- resolution ion microprobe to be installed and operated in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at the University of California, Los Angeles. UCLA is committed to matching more than 50% of the acquisition costs of this equipment. The need to better understand the evolution of the Earth and its natural resources requires continual advances in the ability to characterize the geochemical properties of Earth materials, and isotope geochemistry in particular has made outstanding contributions by permitting age dating of materials and events in Earth history and the use of isotope tracers for delineating the transfer of material during both local- and global-scale processes. The new generation instrument to be acquired through this award will extend existing capabilities in the U.S. for isotopic analysis of Earth materials by permitting micron-scale, in-situ, isotopic analyses with detection limits in the part per billion range. The instrument will be the centerpiece of a facility that will be open to earth scientists outside of UCLA and will permit the fullest application of recent instrumental developments to a better understanding of the origin and evolution of the crust and the genesis of mineral resources.\n",
      "a9004864 OCE $1713507 A central element of the theory of the general circulation of the ocean is the overturning in the meridional plane. This proposal, an element of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE), will deploy mid-depth floats in the Brazil Basin as part of the Deep Basin Experiment (DBE). The investigators will obtain displacement and velocity, as well as temperature and conductivity from floats tracked acoustically for up to 2 years. The data will be analyzed in concert with fixed moorings, hydrographic measurements of the density field and tracers, and numerical models. Major components of the DBE will be done by other countries.\n",
      "a9004869 CMS $160860 The proposed research addresses forward and inverse position kinematics of mechanical configurations comprising combinations of both serial and parallel chain segments. The intent is to lay the foundations of a general theory which will address issues of controllability and complexity of coordination computations. This research covers a broad class of mechanisms which includes systems as diverse as autonomous planetary rover vehicles and flexible manufacturing systems. The study addresses the implications of different ways of combining serial and parallel substructures for the direct and inverse position and rate kinematics of these mechanism, and for the associated force decomposition characteristics. Many examples of such mechanisms have already been developed and include the multi-fingered hand with multiple independently actuated joints in each finger, a parallel mechanism in an overall sense, but with each limb comprising a serial chain with several actuated joints connected in series. Some study of combined serial and parallel mechanisms has occurred, but the topic is clearly in need of expanded research to provide for a comprehensive theory. The theory should allow designers to make use of combination structures in a manner which will provide improved performance over either purely serial or purely parallel architectures.\n",
      "a9004872 EAR $102000 An eighteen month study of taphonomic and sedimentologic processes in a modern marine carbonate environment will be conducted. PIs will assess the biologic and physical and sedimentologic characteristics of six diverse environments in Graham's Harbor, Bahamas. The objectives of the study are (1) to contrast and compare rates of taphonomic loss from a variety of carbonate environments within Graham's Harbor with those measured rates along the Texas coast--are loss rates in clastic environments different than those in carbonate environments? Loss rates in carbonate environments may be less than in clastic environments. If loss rates are less, then the death assemblage and by analyogy, the fossil record, might contain more of the original thought. (2) to recognize transported assemblages on a very fine environmental scale--we will quantify transport between and within habitat in Graham's Harbor. The techniques developed and perfected in this study should be transferable to the analysis of fossil outcrops. (3) size frequency analysis of the living community and death assemblage--do carbonate death assemblages contain a more accurate representation of the population dynamics of the living community than in clastic environments? (4) Taphonomic signatures of the biota from six distinct environments in Graham's Harbor will be determined and compared with the sedimentary record. How closely do sedimentologic parameters reflect taphonomic properties?\n",
      "a9004879 CCR $140391 Covert channels are channels not intended for information transfer. A subliminal channel allows one to hide a secret message inside an authenticator. An abuse enables a participant to us a cryptosystem for a different purpose than intended. In this project, techniques guaranteeing that such abuses are impossible are being studied. The main open problems addressed are: (1) can unconditionally secure authentication schemes be made subliminal- free, and generally, which systems can be made abuse-free; (2)which non-trivial systems can be made abuse-free when using only a passive warden; (3) can the results be extended to analog and digital covert channels?\n",
      "a9004887 IBN $112118 Calcitonin is a peptide hormone produced by special cells in the mammalian thyroid gland and the ultimobranchial gland of birds and fish. In mammals, the hormone is secreted into the bloodstream in response to a rise in blood calcium. It travels to the kidney and bone where is acts on target cells that respond by enhancing renal calcium excretion and reducing bone breakdown, thereby lowering blood calcium back to normal. Dr. Cooper has shown that calcitonin produces behavioral changes when it is introduced into the CNS. Indeed, this peptide has profound effects on food and water intake, pain perception, and gastric acid secretion. Yet, calcitonin has not been found naturally in the brain, and circulating calcitonin cannot get through the blood-brain barrier. Dr. Cooper suggests that a calcitonin-like molecule is present in the CNS but has not been identified because it is different than the one produced in the periphery by the thyroid hormone. He will use structural analogs of calcitonin to isolate CNS receptors, and to determine whether more than one subtype of calcitonin receptor exists. Dr. Cooper will then compare the properties of the CNS and peripheral calcitonin receptors to determine their similarities and differences. In addition, he will characterize the peptide sequences that when introduced into the CNS initiate feeding, drinking and gastric acid secretion. This work will increase our general understanding of how peptides act as chemical messengers in the brain. Moreover, potential usefulness of this work for the development of pharmacological agents for pain control and gastric acid secretion is noted.\n",
      "a9004891 EAR $29791 This award provides 50% of the funding needed to construct five special design reaction vessels for use at high pressure and temperature. The design, construction and operation of the pressure vessels will be under the direction of the Principal Investigator in the Division of Geological & Planetary Sciences at the California Institute of Technology. Caltech will provide the remaining 50% funding necessary for the project. The proposed apparatus incorporates a novel feature whereby the sample is magnetically levitated during an experiment and can be rapidly moved into and out of the hot zone within the vessel without release of pressure. The vessels will be used in a wide variety of projects aimed at understanding the behavior of volatile components in natural and synthetic model igneous systems, including: investigations of the partitioning of hydrogen isotopes between vapor and silicate melts and its relation to the speciation of water in magmatic liquids; studies of the solubility and diffusion of water and carbon dioxide in silicate glasses and melts; study of the partitioning of carbon isotopes between vapor and silicate melts.\n",
      "a9004899 PHY $76874 The purpose is to carry out high precision calculations on the Li isoelectronic series for Z < 10. A number of quantities will be calculated including the energy levels, mass shift, transition isotope shift, hyperfine coupling constant, electron density at the nucleus and relativistic contributions. In particular, a high precision lower bound for the nonrelativistic ground state energy of the Li atom will be computed. This should resolve an issue in the literature concerning the precise location of the ground state energy of Li to a 1 microhartree level of accuracy (.00003 eV). The lower bound will also provide valuable information on the rate of convergence of the variational approach used. Finally, an indirect determination of the Lamb shifts for particular states of the Li I series will be carried out. Lamb shifts for selected spectral transitions will also be evaluated.\n",
      "a9004902 MCB $239872 The proposed research concerns a number of experimental approaches designed to address the question of how the primary sequence of a protein influences spontaneous folding and stability. The investigations will initially involve variants of a protein, bacteriophage lysozyme. Two other bacteriophage proteins will eventually replace the lysozyme as the paradigm of protein folding. Several single- and multiple-site mutants of bacteriophage lysozyme will be selected from a group of existing variants and will be employed in studies of their thermodynamic stability. The types of mutants which will be used include those which, compared to the wild type protein, exhibit altered: (1) sensitivity to thermal inactivation, (2) numbers of charged residues, and (3) cysteine residues capable of forming disulfide bridges. An attempt will be made to experimentally determine electrostatic contributions to protein stability as a function of sequence. Proteins containing genetically-engineered disulfide bridges will be studied to determine the nature of the stability change introduced and also to obtain the free energy of bridge formation for each as a function of pH and temperature. From the latter and the free energy of denaturation of the bridged and un-bridged proteins, a thermodynamic cycle will be constructed. This will permit independent determination of how the free energy of the native and the denatured states are modified.\n",
      "a9004906 DMS $48000 There are two areas which will be addressed in this research. In the first, problems will be considered which are related to a conjecture by Lech concerning the behavior of the Hilbert function under faithfully flat morphisms of local noetherian rings. In the second, the principal investigator will study stability properties of the divisor class group CL(R) where R is a local normal excellent henselian ring. This research is concerned with the geometric properties of commutative rings which arise in algebraic geometry. One of the problems to be considered is a conjecture by Lech which has been unsolved for twenty-five years.\n",
      "a9004909 EAR $83000 This proposal is part of a broader effort to assess the magnitude, timing, and style of Late Paleozoic crustal uplifts and subsidence in eastern Nevada. These basins and associated uplifts are part of a recently recognized phase of Late Pennsylvanian-Permian tectonic instability along the continental margin of the Western U.S. The tectonic drive for these events is unknown and can be assessed only through basin analysis based on integrated and detailed biostratigraphic and lithostratigraphic studies. Previous work has concentrated on the history of one of these basins,the Dry Mountain Trough. Building on the work of Stevens PIs have documented the general tectonic origin of the Dry Mountain Trough, and recognized three distinct east-west divisions of the basin: Eastern Shelf Facies, Central Basinal Facies, and Western Margin Facies. This award is for a two-year intensive study of the Western Margin Facies. The conglomeratic, fluvial to deltaic to shallow marine Western Margin Facies records the tectonism that created the Dry Mountain Trough. PIs will study this record by: (1) tracking the position of the strandline to help document the subsidence history, (2) determining the age and facies progression of the basal units to define structural blocks and document possible differential subsidence, and (3) delineating the sequence stratigraphy and thus assess the timing and style of continued tectonism.\n",
      "a9004923 EAR $79993 Sequence stratigraphic studies of the Alabama Tertiary have resulted in the delineation of approximately twenty depositional sequences, which are interpreted to reflect distinct eustatic sea-level cycles of varying magnitude. The PI recently completed detailed studies of two of these sequences. Significant variations in degree of bioturbation, general ichnofabrics, and discrete trace fossils are observed within and between component systems tracts, and reflect changes in substrate consistency, physical environmental energy, sedimentation rate, and bottom- and/or pore-water chemistry that are consistent with both the phase and magnitude of the associated eustatic cycles. These results demonstrate the potential of extended trace fossil studies in the context of sequence stratigraphy. In order to more fully assess this potential, detailed studies of strata representative of all of the twenty depositional sequences delineated in the Alabama Tertiary are proposed. The objectives of these analyses are: 1) to further assess the response of trace-fossil assemblages to predicted sea- level-mediated paleoenvironmental changes; and 2) to evaluate the ichnological variability that exists between and within systems tracts as a function of differences in depositional environment, lithofacies, and phase and magnitude of associated eustatic cycles. This research will 1) provide an independent test of sequence stratigraphic concepts and interpreted sea-level histories, 2) establish an improved set of ichnological criteria that can be incorporated into models useful for recognizing the eustacy signal, and 3) improve our overall understanding of trace fossils as paleoenvironmental indicators.\n",
      "a9004926 MCB $262000 The long term goal of this research is to understand the functional organization and structural dynamics of the RecA and RecBCD enzymes in order to determine how their many activities are coordinated in carrying out the overall process of genetic recombination. The regions of these enzymes that are involved in particular functions, e.g. DNA binding, ATP binding and hydrolysis, and oligomeric contacts will be identified. Once regions of the proteins have been identified as critical for a given function, a variety of mutagenic techniques will be used, combined with appropriate genetic selections and screens, to detail the structural requirements for that function. Resulting mutant proteins will also be analyzed for their ability to undergo ligand-induced conformational changes, a feature of many multifunctional enzymes which underlies their ability to coordinate various catalytic activities. Further genetic analysis of the relationship between protein structure and function will be performed by using a number of the recombination deficient mutant proteins obtained in this study to select androgenic second site revertants. The analyses of RecA and RecBCD will serve to provide both a more detailed molecular description of genetic recombination, as well as further insights into the mechanisms by which multifunctional, oligomeric enzymes organize a variety of activities into an ordered enzymatic process.\n",
      "a9004937 MCB $50000 The overall goals of this research are to improve the application of spin trapping to phagocyte cells and to better understand the free radical biology of phagocytic cells. Using the spin trap 4- POBN, the investigators have demonstrated that 1-3% of oxygen radical formed can be trapped as hydroxyl radical in a myloperoxidase-mediated reaction. These results will likely resolve a conflicting body of literature. The next aim will be to complete work with 4-POBN. A second goal is to clarify the localization of spin trapping agents. This will be determined by using fluorescent spin trapping probes with confocal microscopy. Finally, during the course of the coming year, studies of the role of lactoferrin in hydroxyl radical formation will be completed. This research will continue development of techniques for the application of spin trapping to the study of biological systems and will contribute to understanding of free radical events within phagocytic cells.\n",
      "a9004942 MCB $178300 The broad-scale goal of this research is to characterize the structure and function of a novel 82 kD protein which was recently identified in this laboratory as a component of adhesion plaques and zonulae adherens of cultured cells. The specific aim of this project is to define the structural features of the 82 kD protein. The primary sequence will be determined by molecular cloning and sequencing techniques. Secondary structure will be predicted and conserved structural motifs and functional domains will be identified. Sequences that are required to address the 82 kD protein to adherens junctions will be defined in transient transfection experiments. Previous work from this laboratory has suggested that multiple isoforms of the protein are present in smooth muscle. The biochemical basis for differences among these isoforms (e.g., post-translational modifications) will be investigated. In addition, rotary shadowing will be used to characterize the molecular shape of the protein. The adherens junctions represent a specialized class of cell-cell and cell-matrix associations that are characterized by the presence of filamentous actin on the cytoplasmic face of the junctional membrane. These include the focal contacts or adhesion plaques of cultured cells, the zonulae adherens (or \"belt desmosomes\") found in the apical junctional complexes of epithelial cells, the dense plaques of smooth muscle, the fascia adherens of cardiac muscle, and the myotendinous junction. These junctions share in common a number of structural features, though they also exhibit a degree of molecular heterogeneity. The finding of a novel 82 kD protein which is localized specifically to these junctions is particularly interesting. The detailed studies to be performed with this award should lead to an understanding of how these junctions are organized and regulated in living cells.\n",
      "a9004953 EAR $20000 The Late-Cenozoic Baikal Rift lies astride a suture between the Archean Siberian Craton and a southerly belt of younger accreted terranes. Basic magmas ranging from hypersthene-normative basalts to strongly nepheline-normative basanites have erupted across the southern end of the Baikal Rift since the Ogliocene, carrying fragments of the underlying mantle to the surface. This is a program of geochemical and petrologic research aimed at evaluating temporal and spatial variations in these mafic magmas and their mantle xenoliths. It will integrate isotopic, whole- rock major and trace element, and mineral chemistry data from basalts and xenoliths collected along a 550-km-long transect across the southern Baikal Rift. The transect extends from Proterozoic-Paleozoic lithosphere in the southeast across the suture onto the Archean craton in the northwest. This study will constitute one of the first of its kind from northern central Asia.\n",
      "a9004960 MCB $95000 A number of S-substituted cysteines are major constituents of the non-protein amino acid pool in species of genera which are widely-separated taxonomically. Enzymes are present which act as C-S lyases and by a beta-elimination reaction yield, in many cases, the characteristic odors and flavors of those plants used as food. In addition the garlic and onion enzymes are of particular interest because the products produced also appear to have marked effects in a number of medical applications. There is one C-S lyase which is present in all autotrophic plants. This is cystathionine-beta-lyase (EC 4.4.1.8) which is required in the biosynthetic pathway of methionine. The other C-S lyases studied to date do not utilize cystathionine as a substrate or do so very poorly. This proposal clarifies the evolutionary relationships among various C-S lyases that have been purified to homogeneity by determining the structural homologies which exist in the protein molecules. Typical examples of each type of lyase have been obtained in a homogeneous state and by the use of peptide mapping and immunological cross-reactions, the homologous regions, if any, are being determined. The active site peptide should be distinguished from the others because of the pyridoxal- 5'-phosphate bound as the secondary amine after reduction. Studying the conservation of protein structure among proteins with similar functions in different organisms has been one approach to elucidate evolutionary origins and relationships. This project examines the degree of relatedness of a group of enzymes limited to a few widely-divergent plant families whose substrates are S-substituted cysteines, which are common secondary metabolites in these families. Determining the evolutionary relationship between these enzymes is important both agriculturally and medically. There is considerable commercial interest in these enzymes in several species such as garlic, onion and broccoli because of their relationship to the characteristic flavors and odors associated with these vegetables. Furthermore, the products resulting from these enzymes have potential medical applications and have aroused pharmaceutical interest.\n",
      "a9004967 MCB $255000 The Dolichos biflorus plant contains a family of lectin genes, some of which are differentially expressed, both spatially and temporally. This laboratory has shown that the genes for two of these lectins, the seed lectin and DB58, are highly homologous and have limited differences in their flanking regions. In the proposed continuation of this work, the tissue specific regulation and developmental expression of these two genes will be examined. Initial studies will focus on transgenic analyses of cis elements of these genes. Transgenic studies coupled with site directed mutagenesis will also be employed in an effort to identify the signals by which these two lectins are targeted to their different subcellular destinations. Basic information gained in this research should contribute to the eventual elucidation of the physiological role of plant lectins and to our understanding of the regulation of expression and intracellular targeting of lectins and other plant proteins.\n",
      "a9004977 MCB $307000 Research indicates that calcium ions and signal-modulated ion channels may play a central role in plant cellular signal transduction. Guard cells provide an ideal system for the study of plant signaling, as these cells respond dynamically to hormone and light stimuli in regulating gas exchange. Recent data suggest that calcium regulation of ion channels in the plasma membrane of guard clls provides a basis for physiologically- observed calcium dependent stomatal movements. Preliminary results show that abscisic acid induces increases in cytosolic calcium, which in turn may trigger stomatal closing, thus protecting plants from desiccation. The goals of the proposed research are to achieve an accurate understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which cytosolic calcium and other ions regulate inward rectifying potassium channels and by which mechanisms abscisic acid exerts control over these processes. Isolated guard cells will be studied by simultaneous patch clamp analysis and photometric measurements of cytosolic calcium, allowing the direct investigation of effects of cytosolic and extracellular modulators on signaling events. The knowledge gained from these studies will contribute substantially to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms controlling gas and water exchange in the leaves of plants and will provide a quantitative description of biophysical and biochemical regulation of ion channels in higher plant cells.\n",
      "a9004979 IBN $195000 This project aims to characterize the 11 desaturases of the cabbage looper moth. Specifically, the DNA sequence of the gene for this enzyme will be determined and compared with similar sequences isolated from desaturase genes in other moth species. It is intended subsequently to extend this work to examine the 10 desaturases in primitive lepidoptera and then to move on to other genes that encode other enzymes involved in pheromone biosynthesis. Sex pheromones are chemical compounds that play a crucial role in insect reproduction. Major components of these pheromones are synthesized in female sex pheromone glands. In this research the principal investigators build on detailed knowledge of pheromone biochemistry by addressing the structure and regulation of the genes encoding these enzymes. The work employs new techniques of molecular biology and should considerably broaden our present horizons about the pheromone communication system so as to provide a basis for gene manipulation in connection with novel insect control strategies.***//\n",
      "a9004980 CHE $349300 This research is being funded by the Organic Synthesis Chemistry Program. It is a continuation of research in the same area. Dr. Hoffman has developed the chemistry of a group of compounds that permits the highly flexible synthesis of number of important classes of structures such as amino acids and heterocycles. These reactions have the potential to simplify the synthesis of otherwise difficultly obtainable substances. The use of 2-sulfonyloxy carbonyl compounds in synthesis has received considerable attention in recent years. 2-Sulfonyloxy carbonyl compounds (ketones and esters) can be prepared readily from enol derivatives of carbonyl compounds, and the sulfonyloxy group introduces distinct reactivity to the product. Of greatest interest is that 2-sulfonyloxy carbonyl compounds undergo very clean nucleophilic substitution. This propensity has been exploited in simple 2-sulfonyloxy ketones and esters as a means to synthesize 2-substituted ketones and unusual amino acid esters. The planned work involves the synthesis of selected, new 2-sulfonyloxy carbonyl compounds, and exploits their special reactivity for the preparation of densely functionalized products. Three specific objectives are set: a) to develop methodology for the synthesis of chiral 3-hydroxy-2-nosyloxy esters and their elaboration into chiral 1,2,3-trifunctionalized compounds, b) to develop the use of unsaturated nosyloxy esters for the synthesis of unsaturated ester derivatives, and c) to continue studies on the electrophilic addition to enamine and enol derivatives of 2-ketoesters.\n",

      "a9004983 IBN $22800 The goal of these studies is to learn about the control of plant cell differentiation. Utilizing epidermal cell redifferentiation into parenchyma during postgenital carpel fusion in Catharanthus roseus to pursue these studies. During normal floral ontogeny in C. roseus, approximately 400 epidermal cells are induced to rapidly redifferentiate during the postgenital fusion of the two carpel primordia. Dr. Verbeke has previously reported experiments involving the placement of water permeable and water impermeable barriers between prefusion carpels which implicate a diffusible agent as the morphogen for redifferentiation. This proposal continues Dr. Verbeke's characterization of communication factors that convey positional information to plant epidermal cells. Specifically she will focus on the following questions: 1) Are the two carpels producing distinct factors, a combination of which are essential for redifferentiation? 2) What are the physical characteristics of these factors? 3) What are the chemical characteristics of these factors? and 4) How universal are the factors? %%% The mechanisms by which patterns of discrete cell types are formed in response to their position is a long standing problem in developmental biology. A cell that reacts in a special way in consequence of association with another must do so because it acquires \"information\" from that other, information that must be conveyed through chemical or physical signals. These experiments continue a characterization of communication factors that convey positional information to plant epidermal cells.\n",
      "a9004984 MCB $40000 Chlorosomes are light-harvesting structures attached to the inner surface of the cytoplasmic membrane in green photosynthetic bacteria. The polypeptide composition of Chloroflexus chlorosomes consists of three major protein components and a fourth minor polypeptide. Functional roles for all four proteins have been tentatively assigned. This project is aimed at determining the role played by these proteins during the development of the photosynthetic apparatus. Recombinant genetic techniques are being used to isolate the genes for two major proteins components of the chlorosome. The gene for one chlorosome protein (Mr 5700) has already been cloned: it contains a coding region for a carboxyl-terminal extension that is not present on the mature protein and which may be important for targetting the protein to the appropriate assembly site within the chlorosome. This investigation deals in detail with the genetic structure, organization and regulation of genes encoding chlorosome proteins. The green and purple photosynthetic bacteria possess a simpler type of photosynthesis than that occurring in higher plants. In these bacteria light is harvested as an energy source to support the synthesis of sugars and other organic components of the bacteria from atmospheric carbon dioxide, but oxygen is not produced. Because of their relative simplicity these bacteria provide useful model systems which are often more amenable to detailed analysis than are higher- plant systems. Studies of bacteria have made major contributions to the advancement of fundamental knowledge of photosynthesis. Dr. Fuller's investigations provide essential information about the structure and function of the biological compounds and complex cellular structures that are responsible for the useful harvesting of sunlight by green bacteria.***//\n",
      "a9004991 IBN $222584 The plant hormone auxin is required for many aspects of plant development. Auxin appears to stimulate cell elongation and cell division in intact plants. Auxin is thought to be essential for plant cell growth because it is absolutely required for growth of plant cells in culture. Despite its importance, very little is known about the mechanism of auxin action. This research proposes to better determine the molecular details of how auxin regulates cellular events as a basis for understanding auxin regulation of development at the level of the whole plant. The focus of this research is Arabidopsis thaliana because it is particularly well suited to both molecular and classical genetic studies. Genes involved in auxin action will be identified from mutants which do not respond normally to applied auxin. One of the mutants isolated in this way is called auxin resistant 1 or axr1. Certain axr1 mutant plants have been characterized in the PI's laboratory and the mutants display a number of defects which suggest defective auxin responses. The AXR1 gene will be cloned and the nucleotide sequence determined. Genetic studies have shown that the gene lies on chromosome one, very close to a previously isolated fragment of DNA. This fragment of DNA will be used to isolate the AXR1 gene using a technique called chromosome walking. Once cloned, the gene will be introduced into axr1 mutant plants using plant transformation procedures developed for Arabidopsis. Loss of auxin resistance in the transformed plants will confirm that the AXR1 gene has been correctly cloned. The DNA sequence of the AXR1 gene will be determined and used to deduce the amino acid sequence of the gene product and will be compared with the sequences of other previously isolated genes. The isolated gene will also allow determination of which cells in the plant are making the AXR1 gene product. The molecular characterization of the AXR1 gene should lead to important new insights into the role of auxin in plant development.\n",
      "a9004994 EAR $54700 The primary goal of the proposed research is to determine the relationship between the debris avalanche of Raung Volcano, Java, to explosive volcanism. The debris avalanche, with its run out length of 60 kilometers is one of the largest in Indonesia and perhaps in the world. It is well exposed and readily accessible. The deposit is interstratified with deposits of magmatic eruptions, some of which are probably deposits of lateral blasts similar to Mount St. Helens blast of May 18, 1980. The central question to be pursued is whether or not the debris avalanche caused an associated magmatic eruption, or a magmatic eruption caused the debris avalanche. This issue is poorly known scientifically and is important for solving more general problems about the development of pyroclastic surges and flows. It is also critical in assessing eruption hazards and development of evacuation and contingency plans in areas of large stratovolcanoes with steeply sloping sides.\n",
      "a9004996 CCR $90911 The objectives of this investigation are to develop inversion principles, data acquisition strategies, and information processing algorithms for an echo imaging system that utilizes the motion of a single element transducer (SET) to synthesize the effect of a phased array with a size equal to the path length that the SET traverses. A mobile SET, with a dimension much smaller than a phased array's size, brings flexibility in data acquisition and processing for echo imaging systems. Synthetic aperture echo imaging also opens ways for imaging an object that cannot be studies with phased arrays due to constraints imposed by the object's anatomy. Unlike the dynamic focusing inversion used in conjunction with stationary phased arrays, the proposed inversion produces an image scene by integrating the recorded echoed signals at the available coordinates of the mobile SET that possesses a wide-beam radiation pattern. The investigation includes modifying an inversion developed for a translational or rotational SET for practical echo imaging problems that arise in diagnostic medicine, remote sensing and non-destructive testing. The required sampling and processing issues associated with the recorded data as well as the resolution anticipated in a given synthetic aperture echo imaging problem are also studied. The result will be used to develop efficient data collection strategies for two-dimensional and three-dimensional echo imaging systems. Sub-band processing of the available spatial frequency data to reduce the computational time for image reconstruction is also being pursued.\n",
      "a9004998 IIS $191000 This research address the problem of providing efficient transactional access to distributed databases. A new mode of locks, termed ordered-shared mode, is proposed that permits data sharing in a constrained manner. A family of locking-based concurrency control protocols is developed by using three modes of locks: shared, ordered-shared, and non-shared. The strictest protocol in this family is the two phase locking protocol for databases, while the most permissive recognizes all conflict- preserving serializable histories. This is the first locking- based concurrency protocol that recognizes the entire class of conflict-preserving serializable histories. Theoretical and empirical studies of these protocols will be conducted during this project. The theoretical comparison is based on the analysis of sets of histories produced by the protocols. The empirical analysis involves building a performance model and a database system test-bed. Distributed database concurrency control protocols based on ordered-shared locks will be developed and implemented on a distributed database test-bed. Finally, the new mode of locks will be used to develop protocols for database system recovery, nested transactions, and abstract data types.\n",

The improvement of P- and S- wave velocity models will be accomplished through expansion of the following observations: augmentation of the waveform data bases using data from many new broad-band digital stations deployed after 1984, expansion of absolute and differential travel-time data sets measured from digital seismograms, and development of a new \"summary travel time\" data base from ISC Bulletins containing seismic station-source region anomalies. Acquisition of this data base will be followed by a joint inversion of waveforms and traveltimes; in the past these data were treated separately. In addition to this primary objective, the acquired data will allow the examination for large scale anisotropy and lateral variations in Q.\n",
      "a9005016 MCB $333338 We will use genetic approaches to study the structure, function and assembly of ribosomal RNA in E. coli. The main feature of the method is to use antibiotic-resistance mutations in 16S and 23S rRNA as genetic markers. This allows us to use both random and site-directed mutagenesis approaches. The construction of inducible rRNA operons allows us to identify lethal mutations, as well. Mutations that confer a variety of phenotypes, including temperature-sensitive, cold-sensitive, \"downs,\" nulls, Ram, suppressors, etc. will be isolated and localized by marker rescue and DNA sequencing. Second site revertants will also be sought, in an effort to identify long-range structural and functional interactions involving ribosomal RNA.\n",
      "a9005021 MCB $99800 Rabbit immunoglobulin allotypes are presumed to be inherited via codominant allelic segregation. However, latent or non-allelic gene activation has been documented for the Ig heavy (H) chain and kappa-1 light (L) chain loci. This laboratory has recently, for the first time, verified the existence of latent kappa-1 light chain mRNA. Latent b5 kappa-1 mRNA was induced in two b4,4 homozygous rabbits following infection with Trypanosoma brucei. In addition, latent b6 cDNA sequences have recently been cloned from an heterozygous b4, b9 rabbit. Employing the polymerase chain reaction and molecular cloning techniques, it has been established that latent b5 and b6 are identical to their nominal b5 and b6 counterparts. The long term goal of this laboratory is to investigate the regulation of these allelic and non-allelic genes. The following studies will be pursued. 1) Using the latent b5 C kappa 1 gene as a model, genomic sequences encoding latent b5 will be investigated employing lymphoid tissue preparations as well as FACS-sorted B cells expressing latent b5. Linkage of the latent b5 to the nominal b4 gene will be explored using in situ hybridization, chromosome mapping, and pulsed field electrophoresis. 2) The functional rearrangement of the latent b5 and b6 genes with V-kappa and J-kappa gene segments will be investigated. 3) It will be determined whether latent b9 kappa-1 sequences exist, and if so, functional recombination with V-kappa and J-kappa regions will be probed. 4) Since rabbits have been found also to be expressing latent a2 and e14 following T.brucei infection, mRNA encoding e14 will be identified by molecular cloning, and functional recombination with V-H, D-H, and J-H gene elements for the chain will be investigated. These studies focused on the expression and genomic organization of three separate latent allotype loci (kappa-1, VHa, CH-gamma) should unequivocally establish their existence at the DNA level, and begin to shed light on their function. The structure of immunoglobulin molecules is determined genetically, i.e., by the structure of the immunoglobulin genes which encode them. The mechanisms by which immunoglobulin genes undergo rearrangements and small changes in the structure of their antigen combining sites is the subject of much current research. Apart from their antigen combining sites, however, immunoglobulin molecules have other distinct stuctural features which vary from one individual to another and are characteristic for the immunoglobulins of a particular individual. Allotypes are examples of such structural features. Since allotypes correspond to segments of immunoglobulin molecules, they would be expected to be inherited by the same rules as other genes. It has been known for some time that in rabbits genetically unexpected allotypes are sometimes expressed. This seems contrary to established principles of inheritance. The proposed research is a continuation of a project directed toward understanding the molecular basis for this long-standing genetic enigma. The results may demonstrate important exceptions to our current ideas about immunoglobulin gene regulation. In any case, they will contribute to our overall understanding of immunoglobulin gene expression.\n",
      "a9005028 ANI $42423 This research concerns the problem of discovering, identifying and locating resources in a nationwide network. The research is based on two fundamental tenets. The first is that users should be able to identify a resource with a set of attributes or properties that describe the resource. For example, rather than having to know the name or address of a processor, the user should be able to state that he or she wants a processor that has a particular architecture, runs a certain operating system, supports a given software package, and is reachable via a specific communication protocol. It should be the naming system's responsibility to locate a resource that matches such a description. The second tenet is that the naming system for a nationwide network will be highly decentralized. The primary reason for this decentralization is not the problem of scale so much as the problem of autonomy. Such a network is expected to consist of a collection of autonomous systems, each of which is responsible for managing and naming its own resources. For example, the National Research and Education Network spans thousands of autonomous organizations. The naming system for such a network probably will be decentralized proportionally.The researchers are investigating methods for identifying resources with a set of attributes, and exploring techniques for searching a large, high decentralized name space. This effort is based on their experience designing and using two experimental naming systems: Profile and Univers.\n",
      "a9005030 EAR $110000 Research objectives are the development of a detailed and semi-continuous isotopic record for the late Paleozoic Era and the testing of its accuracy, and 2) the application of isotope stratigraphy to paleoenvironmental analysis with the specific goal of determining the origin of late Paleozoic cyclical sedimentary deposits. These two objectives are inseparable since understanding the depositional environment is vital for interpreting the isotopic record. The study employs stringent measures to avoid sampling diagenetically altered material. Brachiopod shells are separated from shale matrix, embedded in epoxy, and thin-sectioned. Photographs of these thin sections are taken under cathodoluminescence and plane light, and used as a map to sample non-luminescent calcite from the thin section with a dental pick. Electron microprobe elemental analysis of select shells is used to confirm the use of cathodoluminescence to identify altered shell. The study will concentrate on a limited number of brachiopod species, thereby minimizing or eliminating biological effects on isotopic composition. Sedimentological and paleontological data will also been collected, providing independent evidence for paleoenvironmental change. PIs will analyze brachiopods from late Pennsylvanian deposits in New Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri to examine lateral variations in isotopic composition 1) to test the possibility of using 13C to correlate strata and 2) to define lateral and temporal gradients in ocean paleotemperature and chemistry. PIs will also extend the isotope stratigraphy of the late Paleozoic in Texas to examine paleoenvironmental changes in the epicontinental seas of Texas and to provide a detailed and accurate isotope stratigraphy which can be used as the standard for other studies of stable isotopes in late Paleozoic fossils. Project will apply innovative techniques to analysis of global environmental change in a period of earth history much like today's. Analyses of global change in this time of climatic change may reveal information about the causes, rates and consequences of climate change.\n",

Both theoretical calculations and a series of observations will be made. The principle investigator has been largely responsible for the observational evidence for the existence of the Sunyaev- Zel'dovich effect, which predicts small irregularities in the background radiation due to the effect of clusters of galaxies. These observations and their interpretation are very difficult, and this investigator is widely regarded as the leading expert on these studies. If successful, this work will lead to a greater knowledge of the constituents of clusters of galaxies, and a new method of determining the Hubble constant.\n",
      "a9005039 EAR $70000 Kyanite-bearing mineral assemblages are rare in the Archean where high-grade plutonic-metamorphic terranes tend to be dominated by low-pressure high-temperature metamorphic regimes. This has led to speculations regarding higher geothermal gradients in the Archean and has restricted analogies between high-grade Archean terranes and younger terranes with established relationships to convergent margin plate tectonic settings. This work will expand on a study of Archean rocks in the Quetico subprovince of northeastern Minnesota where kyanite is present and a plate tectonic model has been developed. The objective is to determine the relationship of deformation and metamorphism in the deep crustal level to adjacent shallower levels of the belt exposed to the east. Results are expected to clarify Archean plate settings and the nature of the Archean geothermal gradient.\n",
      "a9005042 CMS $78900 A lesson learned time and again from major urban earthquakes is that the management and operation of transportation facilities play significant roles in the overall earthquake preparedness, response, and recovery. The scope of this study is to extract lessons from the October 17, 1989 San Francisco earthquake in terms of the transportation needs encountered and actions taken. The data obtained will be integrated into a microcomputer-based decision tool with capabilities in graphical network editing and zooming, traffic control and diversion strategies, and mass transit resource management and operations. Similar studies following the 1985 Mexico City earthquake have led to the development of TEDSS, the Transportation Emergency Decision Support System. TEDSS fulfills a number of crucial transportation needs pertinent to Mexico City conditions. These include real-time network editing capabilities, emergency vehicle dispatch, and street clean-up prioritization. The recent San Francisco experience has shown intermediate needs such as route diversions, response to modified travel patterns, and changes in transit demand and routes to also be highly significant in recovery efforts and return to normalcy. These functions will be added to TEDSS making it more adaptable to the U.S. needs and conditions while other TEDSS functions unsuitable to U.S. conditions are deleted. In the course of modifying TEDSS, efficient data structures, graphics modules, heuristics algorithms, and a higher order programming language will be employed to increase the software speed and capacity to handle larger regional street networks.\n",
      "a9005047 MCB $290000 We are examining the telomere region of the fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster, as a model for metazoan telomeres. We have shown that in Drosophila, in contrast to yeast, a chromosome from which the terminus has been deleted can be transmitted for many generations. Our structural analysis of the subterminal portion of the telomere region has revealed a complex interspersion of different repetitive sequences. Preliminary results suggest an unexpectedly high frequency of terminal and subterminal length variations. In addition, we have documented a case in which the expression of a gene was repressed when it was transposed to a subterminal site. The termini of eukaryotic chromosomes, called telomeres, are specialized structures thought to be required for chromosome stability. It has recently been shown that a characteristic terminal sequence motif is conserved among unicellular eukaryotes, vertebrates and higher plants. In many eukaryotes the telomere region also encompasses more complex repetitive sequences that are shared among all or a subset or the chromosome tips. Telomeres have been studied most extensively in single-celled eukaryotes and there is little known about the overall sequence organization, functions, or dynamics of the telomere region of multicellular eukaryotes.***\n",

      "a9005054 EAR $148642 Previous studies of the Miocene Hawthorn Group of the Florida Platform indicate that phosphogenesis occurred primarily during the early to early middle Miocene. The timing of Phosphogenesis appears to be synchronous with a global positive excursion of the carbon isotopic composition (delta13C) of seawater. Preliminary examination of the Hawthorn in northeastern Florida shows that these sediments are rich in phosphorite, dolomite, silica and other minerals indicative of intense upwelling, but contain little organic carbon or pyrite. Burial of isotopically light carbon by deposition of organic-rich, continental margin sequences in the SE U.S. during the early Miocene likely resulted in a global increase in the delta C of seawater. Multiple reworking and supergene weathering from subaerial exposure after the middle middle Miocene oxidized and removed most of the organic carbon and diagenetic pyrite. Rapid oxidation of the buried organic carbon resulted in the delta C of seawater returning to its pre-excursion value. We will test this hypothesis by determining the mechanism and timing of phosphogenesis, the timing of sediment oxidation, and the relationship of these events on the Florida Platform to global sea-level changes and variations in the delta C and delta O of seawater during the Miocene. The research program relies on integrating the seismic sequence stratigraphy, sediment mineralogy and texture, and elemental and isotopic composition of the phosphorite and associate minerals. The Sr isotope stratigraphy of the Hawthorn sections will be compared to the delta C, delta O, and Sr isotope stratigraphy of the Miocene sediments from the southwest Pacific (DSDP Site 588).\n",
      "a9005058 EAR $71640 The extensive 1988 Greater Yellowstone Area (GYA) fires constitute a landscape disturbance of rare magnitude, and one with important ecological, geomorphic, and climatic implications. In order to provide a longer-term perspective on this event, we propose to investigate the history of Holocene sedimentation in northeastern Yellowstone, using actualistic study of modern fire-related and prefire sedimentation as a guide for interpretation of the stratigraphic record. A detailed, highly datable record of Holocene fire-related sedimentation events is preserved in alluvial and colluvial deposits of the Soda Butte Creek drainage. Initial radiocarbon dating of these events suggests a link with times of Holocene climatic change. Comparison of the timing of fire-related events with paleobotanical and climate proxy records can elucidate the relative importance of changing vegetation and hydrological regime, wildfire effects, and intrinsic thresholds in this geomorphic system. We will also examine historical records of meteorological and regional atmospheric conditions associated with both extensive fires and large hydrological events in the GYA, and attempt to develop analogs for climate associated with fire-related sedimentation. This research will help to assess the short-term geomorphic response to the 1988 GYA fires, as well as indicate possible consequences of potential global warming and climatic change for landscape stability in the GYA ecosystem.\n",
      "a9005061 MCB $235000 Past studies have demonstrated substantial physiological similarities between invertebrate and vertebrate immunity. However, such functional similarities might also reflect the convergent evolution of otherwise unrelated systems. Only detailed molecular comparisons will confirm true homology. The long term goal of identifying and characterizing invertebrate recognition molecules is specifically designed to provide such molecular comparisons. Urochordates represent the closest extant ancestor of the chordates, and so have a substantial chance of yielding identifiable molecular homologies with vetebrate immune- related molecules. Monoclonal antibodies directed against urocordate cell surface antigens will be obtained and screened for their capacity to inhibit immunological reactivity in in vitro assays of cytotoxicity and cell proliferation. Inhibitory monoclonal antibodies will be used to purify putative recognition molecules. Unlike previous, unsuccessful investigations, this protocol does not assume that invertebrate recognition structures share similarity with their vertebrate equivalents. i.e. It does not rely on the capacity of anti-vertebrate molecular probes to cross-react with invertebrate determinants, but should identify urochordate recognition structures in the context of their native functions. This project aims to identify and characterize molecules that mediate immunological recognition among invertebrates. Previous analyses suggest that specific immunological recognition is not solely a vertebrate trait. Many invertebrates exhibit adaptive histocompatibility responses that bear considerable similarity to vertebrate immune reactions. Indeed, it is postulated that the adaptive immune systems of higher (vertebrate) animals evolved directly from more primitive systems of recognition that are still expressed among advanced invertebrates. If this hypothesis proves to be true, invertebrates may assume an important role as model systems for the analysis of fundamental imunological mechanisms that remain disguised by the complexity of vertebrate systems. However, before such invertebrate models can be applied to the rationalization of complex problems, the evolutionary homology of vertebrate and invertebrate immunorecognition must be examined. The results of this research on the immunorecognition structures in tunicates should make a substantial contribution toward this goal.\n",
      "a9005062 IBN $234200 Post-translational modifications of proteins regulate important physiological and biochemical processes. One such modification is the covalent attachment of the protein ubiquitin. Only a small subset of the roles of ubiquitin- protein conjugation has been characterized in eukaryotes. Ubiquitin's most well-studied role is as a reusable tag marking proteins for proteolysis. In plants, it has been found attached to the photoreceptor phytochrome and the coat protein of Tobacco Mosaic Virus. The purpose of this research is to explore the function of ubiquitin in physiological processes in higher plants. The biochemical analysis examines the subcellular localization of ubiquitin- protein conjugates in Arabidopsis. The molecular analyses of ubiquitin gene expression in higher plants involve 1) isolation of the remaining member(s) of the ubiquitin extension gene family from Arabidopsis, 2) determination of the regulation of expression of different members of the ubiquitin extension gene family and 3) definition of the promoter regions for the ubiquitin extension genes by deletion analysis and site-directed mutagenesis and re- introduction into plants. Ubiquitin is a protein that is widely distributed in plant, animal, yeast and bacterial cells. It is one of the most highly conserved proteins known, having only three amino acid differences between the human and higher plant protein. It serves a number of important biological roles in the cell, the most fully characterized being its role in marking proteins for breakdown, especially abnormal proteins. Current understanding of the regulation of the ubiquitin pathway is rudimentary. Therefore, the goal of these studies is to provide fundamental information on the regulation of the ubiquitin pathway and the regulation of their genes in higher plants.***\n",
      "a9005068 DMS $10500 The principal investigator will analyze conformal metrics on compact Riemannian manifolds which either have or do not have boundaries. The existence of positive solutions to semilinear elliptic equations with non-linear boundary conditions will also be investigated. Additionally, topological obstructions to the existence of metrics with positive curvature on compact manifolds with boundary will be studied in detail. The sphere is the only two-dimensional compact surface which can have positive curvature everywhere; that is, at each point there are two distinct directions in which the surface bends \"down.\" Points on a saddle have negative curvature for the saddle bends down in one direction, but up in other directions. Tori, or surfaces of donuts, cannot have positive curvature everywhere, regardless of how they are deformed. The principal investigator will study the analogous question for higher- dimensional compact hypersurfaces.\n",
      "a9005069 EAR $106308 Considerable motivation exists to study processes that govern the abundance and distribution of rock debris at the base of ice masses because they figure importantly in the dynamics and geomorphic manifestations of glaciers and ice sheets. The proposed work is aimed at better understanding how erosional processes operate to generate and modify debris at the glacier bed, and how transport processes mix, disperse and eventually eliminate this debris. Researchers will complete a theoretical model of glacial quarrying and refine a new model of abrasion, which provides for the first time a quantitative link between all major processes governing both the erosion of bedrock and the abundance of basal debris. Then, armed with new model results about quarrying of debris from the bed and particle/bed interactions, it is possible to re-analyse considerable published data on glacial drift, including dispersal patterns, spatial variations in grain size, and particle textures reflecting wear and fracture. The physical insight and quantification gained from the models will shed significant new light on the genesis of glacial debris, and lead to more precise inferences about the behavior of unlithified material at the base of ice sheets and glaciers than has been previously possible. The proposed research is a natural extension of the work nearly completed on large-scale glacial erosion, with funds from ERA87-08400. This study provides a firm foundation for the proposed refinement of our erosion analysis, and its application to the glaciological interpretation of key characteristics of glacial sediments.\n",

Models of orogenesis to be tested include bulk shortening, transpressive thrusting, contractional thrusting and magmatic accretion. Evaluation of these models will utilize mineral thermobarometry, fabric analysis and U-Pb Zircon geochronology and pertains to a larger view of the orogen as either a collisional welt related to terrane accretion, or as a complex Andean-type magmatic arc developed on the edge of the North American craton.\n",

      "a9005078 EAR $17700 Existing volcanic eruption models need to be superceded by a more adequate modelling, since many observations of eruption columns, blasts and related phenomena still lack theoretical explanation. Careful theoretical analyses are essential to provide explanations against which field observations may be tested, and to provide the stimulus for new, insightful approaches to field investigation. Accurate modelling is now feasible due to availability of advanced numerical techniques and supercomputers. We therefore propose to develop a rigorous unified computational model for volcanic eruptions involving: three-dimensional, unsteady, turbulent, compressible, thermoviscous, multiphase radiating flow, with interaction from extraneous water, arbitrary cross-wind profiles, stratified humid atmosphere, and realistic ground topography. Vent orientation and shape will be arbitrary. This grant will partially support a graduate student who will participate in the development of this model under the supervision of the two PIs.\n",
      "a9005079 MCB $284922 The dynein ATPases are complex, multisubunit enzymes that generate the forces for a variety of microtubule-based movements. The function of the different dynein subunits in the generation of motility is largely unknown, but the study of mutants with defective flagellar motility in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has identified several genes that alter the structure and function of the outer dynein arm. One of these genes, the sup-pf-1 locus, is the structural gene for the B subunit of the outer arm complex. The mechanisms by which the B chain contributes to dynein activity and flagellar motility will be studied by the analysis of wild-type and mutant alleles of the sup-pf-1 locus. The specific aims are: 1) To characterize the microtubule binding and translocation properties of wild-type and mutant B subunits by in vitro assays. 2) To determine the physical locations of the microtubule binding site (s) and the sup-pf-1 regulatory regions by photolytic and proteolytic cleavage techniques. 3) To identify the position of specific functional domains within the DNA sequence of the B chain gene, and to characterize the DNA sequences in both mutant and wild-type alleles. This combined genetic, biochemical, and molecular approach will provide new insights into the basic mechanisms of dynein-based motility.\n",

      "a9005081 IBN $360000 Vertebrates have diverse reproductive cycles spanning continua from brief to prolonged breeding seasons, and from precisely timed to opportunistic reproductive periods. Variations in the timing of gonadal maturation and onset of breeding require that individuals of a population or species adjust secretion of reproductive hormones in response to environmental signals. Dr. Wingfield proposes to develop a mathematical model to describe the type of breeding cycle for a given population. Of particular interest are the degrees of constancy and contingency within a particular breeding cycle. The more constancy within a cycle (e.g. the environment is in a state conducive to breeding most of the time), then less environmental information is required to regulate secretion of reproductive hormones and thus optimize breeding. As contingency in the cycle increases (e.g. the environment shows major changes in suitability for breeding within a year), more environmental cues are required to time onset of breeding. The PI has chosen several avian species, with varying degrees of constancy and contingency in their reproductive cycles, as tests of this model. The responses of each species to environmental signals known to influence reproductive function (e.g. annual change in daylength, temperature, availability of food) will be tested. Their effects on gonadal development, and secretion of reproductive hormones will be measured. Ultimately, the effects of these environmental cues on gene expression for hormones within the brain, that act as a link between the environmental and internal processes, will also be determined. The proposed research is designed to explore the possibility of a unifying theory that can be used to predict how all vertebrates (and perhaps all organisms) integrate signals from the environment in order to optimize reproduction. It may also be possible to use this model for processes other than reproduction (e.g. migration, growth etc.) The research will provide new insight into the mechanisms by which environmental signals are transduced into internal processes (such as hormone secretion) that regulate reproductive function. This may have considerable impact on our knowledge of reproduction in general, and could provide a firm base for approaching problems of how to breed and protect endangered species and populations.\n",

      "a9005088 EAR $77000 PI will investigate the animal sediment relations and biogenic sedimentary structures of palagic carbonate systems in both shelf-sea and deep-sea settings. Emphasis will be on interpreting the environmentally controlled trace fossil associations, ichnofabrics (modes of occurrence, preservation, deformation and juxtaposition of trace fossils) and paleoethology (fossilized evidence of animal behavior) preserved in pelagic deposits in New Zealand and Denmark. Palagic sediment is ideal for such studies, because (a) bioturbation rates typically far exceed depositional rates, (b) pelagic ooze occurs in regimes far removed from direct perturbations of continental sediment influx, and (c) the open-water setting allows for global comparisons and synthesis. Similarities and differences of ichnofabric, ichnofacies and particular ethologic types of trace fossils will be documented in pelagic limestone and chalk deposited in mid-latitude boreal seas of the Southern and Northern Hemispheres during Late Cretaceous and Early Tertiary time. The work will focus on the Maastrichtian-Oligocene Amuri Limestone on the South Island of New Zealand and Maastrichtian-Paleocene chalk in Denmark. In addition, DSDP/ODP and commercial drill cores of deep-sea carbonate sections from nearby sites in the southwestern Pacific and northeastern Atlantic will be examined. This ichnologic research will provide a detailed picture of organism-substrate interrelationships in ancient pelagic ooze habitats, and it also will allow construction of a global picture of endobenthic communities in non-tropical, mid-latitude, epicratonic sea-bottom environments.\n",
      "a9005092 EAR $120000 This research deals with the structural evolution of strike- slip fault zones as related to the statistics of earthquakes in those zones and the geometry of the fault traces. Significant results have already been obtained for the San Andreas fault in California and the Anatolian fault in Turkey. The work is to be extended to faults in the Mojave Desert in California and strike- slip faults in Japan. These ideas have not only yielded new physical insights into faulting but have important implications for earthquake hazard assessment. This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.\n",

In order to reach the potential sensitivity of third-generation, ultralow-temperature gravitational-wave detectors, significant improvement must be made in the transducers. Prof. Paik will construct, test, and deliver new transducers to work with the most sensitive bar detectors at Stanford and Louisiana State Universities. This collaboration will enable those receivers to reach new levels of sensitivity within the next three years.\n",
      "a9005098 MCB $54830 Plants are a major source of fine chemicals (secondary metabolites) including pharmaceuticals, fragrances, flavors, and pesticides. Although there has been but limited success in the profitable production of secondary products from plant cultures there is serious interest in the use of plant cell and tissue culture for the production of these valuable commodities. Many of these products are produced by roots, so the use of plants transformed by Agrobacterium, yielding hairy roots, offers great potential for comercial exploitation. Hairy roots are genetically stable, grow rapidly, and produce levels of secondary products equal to or greater than the whole plant. Root hairs, however, are easily damaged in conventional bioreactors. A further barrier to the use of these plant tissues on a commercial scale is that most secondary metabolites accumulate within the plant tissue and are not readily exported into the growth medium. Thus, there is a need for nondestructive methods for culturing hairy roots and methods by which the products produced by these plant tissues can be recovered for processing while still retaining the biomass. The goals of the proposed research are to grow hairy roots of beets (Beta vulgaris) in a new bioreactor which employs nutrient mists, and to test physical techniques for the reversible permeabilization of cells for release of products into the medium. The proposed research will lay the groundwork for development of a unique model system for the large scale growth of plant hairy roots and development of techniques for the recovery of commercially valuable products (secondary metabolites) from these specialized plant tissues.\n",

      "a9005104 DMS $17261 Work on this project focuses on questions arising in the mathematical theory of several complex variables. The research concerns the nature of mappings between domains in spaces of several complex variables - possibly of different dimension. A specific problem of interest is that of constructing maps from balls of different dimension which are proper and holomorphic. Proper means effectively that the mappings look finite-to-one locally. The maps are to be in certain Lipschitz classes up to the boundary. This degree of smoothness has yet to be obtained; the best result to date assumes differentiability up to the boundary. In such a case, the only mappings turn out to be rational. If the first domain is not a ball, then the target domain in general cannot be a ball. A more likely target is the unit sphere of a Hilbert space. In such cases, pseudoconvex domains with analytic boundaries can be mapped by proper maps. This project will go further in lowering the condition on the boundary to demonstrate that differentiable proper maps can be obtained.\n",

      "a9005111 DMS $42686 Professor Sahi will apply algebraic and analytic techniques to study the spectrum of certain invariant differential operators on Hermitian symmetric spaces. Among the intended applications are (i) invariant theory: to establish identities generalizing the classical Capelli identity, (ii) representation theory: to study certain reducibility and unitarizability questions, (iii) analysis: to describe the homogeneous distributions on a formally real Jordan algebra and to extend Maxwell's theory of poles of spherical harmonics to this setting, (iv) number theory: to extend results of Shimura on the arithmeticity of certain non- holomorphic vector-valued Eisenstein series. The work described above involves the theory of representations of groups. Group theory is basically the theory of symmetry. To take a simple example, when the system in question is invariant under a change in the position of the origin of space, the group of translations naturally arises. While groups are abstract objects, particular situations demand concrete realizations or \"representations\" of the symmetry group.\n",

These objects dominate the universe in terms of numbers, although their contribution to the total mass is poorly known. Indeed, most of our knowledge of star formation in external galaxies, and of galaxy properties in general has come from studies of systems which may not be typical. These workers will explore the properties of these much more numerous objects by both optical and radio means. Preliminary work by these investigators has already resulted in the discovery of the two largest, most gas-rich spiral galaxies known, both systems of very low surface brightness.\n",

These investigators, widely considered to be world leaders in their field, will complete an optical survey of over 1000 bright quasars using broadly based and quantifiable selection criteria. This new observational material will be used to make a number of studies not previously possible. Among these will be a probe of a very large supercluster of absorbers lying in front of several quasars, studies of the relationship between radio and optical power in quasars, and investigations of possible links between nonthermal optical properties of quasars and their VLBI radio emission.\n",
      "a9005118 DMS $100778 This research will be conducted in several areas of probability and ergodic theory: 1) Construction and fundamental properties of Gibbs states on sequence spaces with countable alphabets; 2) applications to dynamical systems with countable symbolic dynamics, e.g., geodesic flows on noncompact manifolds and conformal dynamical systems with parabolic points; 3) related problems concerning statistical regularities of orbits in flows; and 4) temporal and spatial growth in branching diffusion processes and branching random walks. This research is a blend of statistical theory, dynamical systems, and ergodic theory. There is a broad class of dynamical systems for which the well-developed machinery of symbolic dynamics is available. This class is characterized by the fact that the associated symbolic dynamics needs only a finite alphabet (so one has to deal with finite state Markov processes). This research extends this class to those systems for which an infinitely countable alphabet becomes necessary and develops the corresponding machinery. This will provide the tools for obtaining new results about the clustering of orbits at limit sets and about the statistics of closed geodesics on Riemannian manifolds. The outcome of this work will be to unite many known results which were won by very different methods, so unifying, thus simplifying, areas with quite separate results.\n",
      "a9005129 DMS $10250 The principal investigator will extend (in both complex analytic and Lie theoretic directions) his previous work on analytically representing intersection cohomology of singular spaces by L2-cohomology. In particular, he proposes to find complete Kaehler metrics on the smooth locus of projective varieties whose L2-cohomology represents the intersection cohomology of the singular variety. The principal investigator will extend ideas used in his solution to the Zucker conjecture to the case of complete Kaehler metrics. This conjecture stated that except in certain specified cases, the L2- and intersection cohomology were essentially the same. Cohomology is the dual of homology. Thus, cohomology consists of a sequence of groups of functions which are tied together by a sequence of \"co-boundary\" functions. These structures have been used to catalog hypersurfaces of many dimensions.\n",

      "a9005135 CTS $325000 This work is directed toward understanding the kinetics and mechanisms of heterogeneous selective oxidation of cycle alkenes and of oxygen-addition reactions and selective oxidation of linear alkenes on selected metal surfaces, principally silver. It includes the identification of reaction products and determination of reaction selectivity under oxygen-rich and oxygen-lean conditions; the determination of the rate-determining step in the formation of each product, and of the activation energy and preexponential factor for each such steps; the identification of reaction intermediates, and the clarification of the details of the elementary bond-breaking and bond-forming processes leading from reactant to product. The study employs a combination of ultrahigh-vacuum techniques including temperature-programmed reaction spectroscopy and vibrational spectroscopy; in some cases, synchrotron radiation techniques are used to assist in the determination of adsorbate geometries. The systems under study form the basis of a number of commodity and specialty chemical processes in which selectivity and minimization of deleterious byproducts are crucial to commercial success. This work should provide valuable guidance for design improvements and control in these processes.\n",

      "a9005148 DMR $307000 This research concerns a fundamental study of the effect of low levels of copolymers on the properties of aqueous colloidal suspensions. Systematically designed, novel, block and graft copolymers with narrow molecular-weight distributions of each block will be synthesized and mixed with selected colloidal particles having narrow-size distributions. The effect of the adsorbed copolymers on the stability and properties of the suspensions will be measured by techniques including rheology and light scattering. The particle concentrations will range from dilute to highly concentrated in order to study the critical effect of particle concentration on suspension microstructure. Steric stability is provided by a water-soluble tail segment on the copolymer that is anchored to the particle by an adsorbed hydrophobic head block. The effectiveness of the water-insoluble block as an anchor will be studied as a function of chemical structure. It is anticipated that specific interactions between the particle surface and the adsorbed copolymer will be of particular importance in aqueous, hydrogen-bonding media. In addition to the steric stabilization mechanism, electrostatic stabilization is also important for the case of charged tail segments. The particles to be studied will be well-characterized inorganic materials, primarily SiO2, Al2O3, SiC, and Si3N4.\n",

      "a9005155 CTS $59521 This research will focus upon porous polymeric materials exhibiting a uniform sub-micron cell size which show great promise in applications such as membranes, catalyst supports, artificial skin, etc. Current liquid-based phase separation technologies for producing these materials are limited be difficulties in solvent removal and structural heterogeneity introduced by thermal gradients. It is proposed to generate uniform, cellular polymeric materials via a micro-phase separation induced in a polymer network swollen by a supericrtical fluid. By taking advantage of the strong dependence of solvent power on pressure, a unique characteristic of supercritical fluids, one can assume finer control over the microstructure in porous materials than is presently available using conventional liquid solvents. The research program will be divided into two phases. In the first, the equilibrium swelling composition and the relaxation behavior of a polymer network exposed to supercritical CO2 will be measured using a quartz spring microbalance and dielectric spectrometer, respectively. These will be the first such measurements on a network/supercritical fluid system. In the second phase, microporous materials will be generated via a phase separation in a supercritical fluid- swollen network. Porosity will be measured using conventional techniques and correlated with the fundamental thermodynamic information compiled during the initial program phase.\n",
      "a9005159 DMS $36585 The study of large-scale systems and methods of computing their optimizations is an important area with many applications. Stochastic Programming is an important area in such studies. This activity will focus on development of stochastic programming problems. Large scale here means the number of constraints as well as the number of decision and random variables in the problem can be large. Both probabilistic (reliability type) constraints and penalties for deviations are incorporated into the models. The random variables are discrete in some of the models and continuous in others but stochastic dependence is allowed in all cases. In the case of continuously distributed random variables a multivariate numerical integral approximation technique, will be used. Possible applications include optimization of earthquake resistant structures, water level regulation in lake systems, planning in interconnected power systems, solutions of economic, finance, production problems.\n",

The deep structure beneath spreading centers in the back-arc provides important constraints on the dynamics of the spreading process. Attenuation and velocity anomalies in the vicinity of the rift will be measured by comparing sS and sScS phases with direct S and ScS waveforms which have similar paths through the lower mantle to the receiver.

      "a9005164 MCB $285000 The plant hormone, ethylene, regulates a wide range of physiological and developmental processes in higher plants. While a significant amount of progress has recently been made in the elucidation of the ethylene biosynthetic pathway and in the molecular bases for a number of ethylene regulated processes, virtually nothing is known about the receptor and associated signal transduction pathways in plants. The goal of this proposal is the molecular cloning and characterization of the ETR locus in Arabidopsis thalina. Mutations in the ETR locus have been isolated which cause insensitivity to a number of ethylene responses in the plant. Physiological evidence indicates that the mutations directly effect the ethylene receptor. From a chromosome walk, an 18 kb region of cloned genomic DNA has been obtained which appears to carry the ETR gene. The investigators intend to identify the specify sequences in this region that represent the ETR gene and to obtain full length cDNA clones of the mutant and wild type genes. The cDNA clones will also be used to manipulate the level of expression of the wild type and mutant gene products in transgenic Arabidopsis and in a number of other plant species. Engineered mutations in the gene will allow an exploration of the dominant nature of the etr phenotype.\n",
      "a9005173 MCB $304000 Prior results from this laboratory have shown that elicitors of a plant's defense response bind to receptors on the plant cell surface and within 0-8 minutes stimulate a burst of hydrogen peroxide. This sudden production of hydrogen peroxide serves not only to destroy certain pathogenic compounds but may also stiimulate subsequent phytoalexin production. The next goals of this research are to characterize the oxidative burst, determine its role in triggering phytoalexin biosynthesis, evaluate whether other defense compounds are induced by the oxidative burst, and identify the enzymes and substrates involved in its synthesis. Recent results also indicate that the elicitor molecule is internalized via endocytosis following association with its receptor on the plant cell surface. In further experiments, the kinetics of internalization of the receptor will be examined, and its path will be monitored as it moves from the cell surface to its final intracellular destination . Whether receptors for different elicitors follow identical pathways will also be evaluated. Finally, it has been found that plant cells have receptors for biotin and that macromolecules can be delivered into a living plant cell via biotin receptor-mediated endocytosis if the macromolecules are first covalently derivatized with biotin. The use of this pathway to deliver enzymes, nucleic acids, toxins and antibodies, etc into living plant cells will be explored. Just as higher animals have well developed immune responses to defend against pathogens, higher plants also have defense responses that allow them to resist invasion and damage. The mechanisms by which plant defense responses are regulated is a very important fundamental problem about which, thus far, little is known. With prior NSF support, Drs. Low and Heinstein discovered that exposure of soybean cells to a chemical trigger (\"elicitor\") of a defense response is followed very quickly by production of hydrogen peroxide by the plant cells. The further goals of this research are to clarify the role of hydrogen peroxide in the defense response, and to pursue other leads concerning the sequence of events between exposure of a plant to a potential pathogen and the production by the plant of protective chemicals. The results of this project should contribute to our understanding of the cellular signaling mechanisms that regulate plant defense responses.\n",
      "a9005176 IBN $240000 The aim of the work described in this proposal is to test directly the hypothesis that an endogenous electrical field in the chick embryo acts to guide lumbo-sacral neural crest cells to their targets in the hind gut. Dr. Robinson will do this by manipulating the endogenous field during the period of crest cell migration. This field, which is the result of a large current that leaves the posterior intestinal portal, will be altered by shunting the current which generates it through wounds created in the integument, or by voltage clamping the embryonic transepithelial potential, thus eliminating or reversing the endogenous field. The fluorescent dye DiI will be used to trace the neural crest cells during their migration. Dr. Robinson will also do a light and electron microscopy study of tail gut degeneration in the chick in order to establish that this process is responsible for the currents he detects leaving the posterior intestinal portal. The in vitro effects of an applied electrical field on the proposed endogenous field target cells will also be examined. He will extend his vibrating probe observations to mouse embryos, particularly some of the mutants that are available, in order to determine if changes in any of the endogenous current parameters are indicative of specific abnormalities. The information gained from these experiments will add substantially to our knowledge of how migratory cells are guided during development.\n",
      "a9005179 EAR $255000 The demonstration of a major advance from a Labradorean dispersal center flowing essentially at right angles to regional topographic features, and that overtopped Loks Land despite an unconstrained margin facing the open ocean to the SE, provides strong evidence that the flux of ice during this advance must have been great. The cross-sectional area for that portion of the ice facing the Labrador Sea is ca. 300 km2. Assuming a velocity between that of Jacobshavn Glacier, an outlet glacier draining the Greenland Ice Sheet (8 km a-1), and the Ross Ice Shelf, Antarctica (1 km a-1) yields an annual flux of 300 to 2400 km3 a-1. This is about the same fresh-water flux entering the North Atlantic when the St Lawrence outlet was opened by the retreating Laurentide Ice Sheet 11,000 years ago (30,000 m3 sec-1 or 1000 km3 a-1; Teller, 1988). Recognizing the importance of ice-sheet/ocean interactions in the global climate system, we are proposing a research campaign to include a new field effort to define more precisely the spatial limits of this newly recognized advance, and the timing of its onset and retreat, and to model the ice dynamics based on the field evidence. Specifically, we intend to address five objectives: 1) Defining the maximum limits of the Labradorean advance; 2) Deciphering the interaction between the Foxe outlet glacier the flowed out Frobisher Bay and the Labradorean ice sheet backfilling the bay; 3) Determining whether all of Meta Incognita Peninsula was over-ridden by Labradorean ice; 4) Defining the temporal limits of these advances; and using the field evidence on the limits and timing of ice sheet advance and retreat as input to glaciological models to provide realistic ice limits, and ice velocities. Accurate reconstructions of the overall configuration of the Laurentide Ice Sheet and the pattern of its flow are necessary to understand the climate and general circulation during a glaciation, the response of the earth's crust to loading, and contribute to our understanding of ice dynamics.\n",
      "a9005180 SES $41339 The purpose of this research is to develop several applications of the Likelihood Principle for investigating macroeconometric problems that have been difficult to address using classical methods. Further, methods will be devised for evaluating the performance of these procedures in repeated samples, and for illustrating the impact of a broad range of different assumptions on the results. The first consideration is whether macroeconomic time-series-data are best described as integrated or trend- stationary. The performance of Classical integration and co- integration tests will be compared against trend-stationary alternatives. In addition, a method will be devised for examining the performance of macroeconomic models from a Bayesian perspective, and to seek the appropriate interpretation of classically obtained results. Finally, the theory of dynamic games will be extended to models in which the structure of the relevant model is not known with certainty. This research is important because it will provide better methods for analyzing time-series-data, which is the type of data used in much of the empirical research in economics and the other social sciences.\n",
      "a9005182 IBN $265838 Interactions between the immune and endocrine systems were first postulated nearly a century ago. Investigations of the interactions between these two important biological systems were sporadic over the next nine decades; however, within the last few years, scientist have begun to realize the importance of these two systems, and their interactions, in maintaining normal body functions and combating disease states. Dr. Kasson has recently identified a new protein produced by white blood cells of the immune system which communicates important stimulatory information to the reproduction endocrine system. He thinks that this protein may represent an important factor in immune-endocrine communication and have proposed studies to investigate the nature and functions of this protein. Initially he will define the nature and structure of the protein and identify any similarities between this protein and other known proteins. Latter studies will investigate how this protein interacts with cells of the reproductive system and how it elicits responses in reproductive cells. These studies will provide new information on how the immune endocrine systems communicate and may uncover new insights into how defects in these pathways produce disease states. A better understanding of the interactions between these two important biological regulatory systems may lead to new therapies to treat disease states involving deficits in immune-endocrine regulation (i.e. autoimmune diseases, diabetes, hyperthyroidism, infertility, etc.)\n",

The use of a protein which becomes highly expressed during metamorphosis as the model for study ensures that the findings will further our understanding of, and ability to disrupt, a fundamental and developmentally critical point of regulation of insect development. The occurrence and importance of JH in a wide range of invertebrate groups ensures that the results will have wide significance and applicability towards invertebrates. It is also probable that the results of such studies on juvenile hormone will have important implications for studies on the action of retinoic acid in regulation of vertebrate gene expression.\n",
      "a9005193 IBN $259594 Inorganic phosphate is an important part of cells as well as body components such as bone. The amount of phosphate within an organism can alter bodily calcium balance, acidity of body fluids, and growth. Phosphate regulation is therefore important in all vertebrates. Dietary intake, intestinal absorption and renal excretion determine the body phosphate balance. The processes in the kidneys which control the excretion of phosphate are not understood in animals such as birds and fishes. Unlike mammals, the latter have a mechanism to transfer phosphate directly from blood to the urine through kidney cells. The objectives of this work include the study of the mechanism of phosphate transfer at both the cellular and cell membrane levels. Regulation of phosphate excretion by the kidneys involves the interaction of hormones, acid-base balance, and dietary phosphate availability. Dr. Renfro will examine the basic cellular processes by which these factors alter body phosphate.\n",

      "a9005195 MCB $321000 The object of this study is the investigation of the conformational dynamics of components of protein biosynthesis systems from bacterial and higher organisms. Specifically, elongation factors from c. coli and from calf brain will be studied both in isolated forms and in complexes with appropriate components from their respective protein biosynthesis systems. In the case of the E. coli protein, the complexes will be the guanine nucleotide bound forms, the heterodimer formed with still another elongation factor, the ternary complex formed with guanine nucleotide and aminoacylated-tRNA and the complex formed with the antibiotic aurodox. The elongation factor from calf brain will also be studied in its complexes with guanine nucleotides and with other elongation factors. The goal of these studies will be to examine the nature and extent of the conformational alterations which occur upon formation of these various biologically important complexes as well as to elucidate hydrodynamic aspects of the complexes. In addition to providing information on these important components of protein biosynthesis systems the proposed studies will also have relevance to related research on other quinine nucleotide binding proteins.\n",
      "a9005196 HRD $180000 The first objective of this work is to develop regenerable polymeric reagents for asymmetric reductions. The reagents will be complexes of optically active (chiral) helical polymers and borane. These polymers are conveniently synthesized by living anionic polymerization techniques using chiral initiators. An example of such an optically active polymer is poly (phenyl-2-pyridyl-o- tolylmethylmethacrylate). The presence of the 2-pyridyl groups in the polymer should allow for the preparation of the optically active polymer/borane complexes similar to poly (2-vinylpyridine)/borane complexes. The optically active reducing reagents will be used to reduce prochiral carbonyl functionalities. The second objective of the project is to synthesize a class of isotactic polymers which will exhibit specific secondary structures i.e. helix. This goal will be accomplished by first developing an understanding of the relationship between the structure of the monomer and the tendency to isotactic specific polymerization. The starting point of this project will be the synthesis and stereochemical characterization of poly (4-vinylquinoline) and poly (2-vinylnaphthalene). It is expected that such isotactic polymers with specific secondary structures or \"steric-stereoregular\" polymers will have potential applications in molecular biology, synthetic enzymes and regenerable asymmetric reagents.//\n",
      "a9005199 EAR $95900 This project is to investigate the accretion of the Earth and the separation of the Earth's core and crust from the Earth's mantle, by analyzing well characterized samples from different geochemical reservoirs with neutron activation analysis for the moderately siderophile and chalcophile trace elements Mo, W, As, and Sb, and by determination of metal/silicate partition coefficients for As and Sb. The varying depletion relative to elements with different affinities for Fe-metal or sulfide provide clues to the events involving accretion and metal segregation in the mantle, including the possibility of late veneers that accreted on the Earth after core formation, or the possibility of metal retention in the mantle during core formation. Determining the abundances and depletion of these elements un samples from terrains of different geological ages will also address the timing of core formation in the Earth, because the possibility of continued core formation through a substantial portion of geologic time has been invoked to explain some of the recent lead isotope results for samples from the mantle.\n",

      "a9005202 IBN $361000 Insect growth and metamorphosis is controlled primarily by the molting hormone, 20-hydroxyecdysone (20HE), and juvenile hormone (JH) which, when present, prevents metamorphosis. A neuropeptide, eclosion hormone, then triggers ecdysis at the end of each molt. During the next 5 years, this project will focus on the action of these hormones in the context of identified genes in the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta, and the fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster. The particular projects include: 1) The spatial and temporal patterning of ecdysteroid receptors in the epidermis during a larval molt and the larval-pupal transformation and their relationship to the competence of the cells to respond to the hormone. 2) Structural analysis of the gene for insecticyanin, the pigment necessary for adaptive coloration, hormonal regulation of its expression, and factors involved in the bidirectional secretion of this protein. 3) The dual role (induction and repression) of 20HE in determining the timing of expression of gene for dopa decarboxylase, the enzyme necessary for cuticular melanization and hardening after ecdysis. 4) The role of ecdysteroid in the regulation of eclosion hormone gene expression and of these two hormones in the onset of alcohol dehydrogenase gene expression at adult eclosion in Drosophila. These studies will clarify our understanding about how 20HE and JH act together to regulate specific genes during a larval molt and at metamorphosis and how the changing ecdysteroid titer may coordinate the onset of gene expression during a molt. Furthermore, they will define for the first time in a complex system how a neuropeptide and a steroid hormone interact to control specific gene expression. This in-depth knowledge about the mode of action of these critical developmental hormones should also serve as a basis for new approaches to insect control.\n",

Existing, but recently developed methods of analysis, including robust multivariate transfer function (or response space) estimates; methods for combining non-simultaneous arrays (and treating missing data in a large array); a new method for combining all components of the transfer functions to produce smooth maps of magnetic fields of internal origin and methods for approximate (almost linear) inversion of long period anomalous magnetic field data for integrated surface conductance, will be applied to the 83 station land array.\n",
      "a9005211 IBN $229500 A complete developmental and molecular analysis of the 1(2)Cf (Cf) gene in Drosophila melanogaster will be carried out. Cf mutations produce brain hemispheres 5-10x the normal size in late 3rd instar larvae without affecting the ventral ganglion. Cf brain tissue when transplanted into wild type adult hosts becomes tumorous and malignant. The cloned gene is located within 46kb of the dopa decarboxylase gene and is part of the Ddc gene cluster which is involved in catecholamine metabolism and scleroticizaton of the cuticle. Cf mutations also produce a weakened cuticle phenotype in pharate adults and are cell lethals in adult epidermis. Sequencing of the cloned gene will be completed and the derived amino acid sequence examined to determine the nature of the protein and its possible function. Homology to vertebrate genes, some of which may be potential tumor suppressor genes, will be sought. To investigate Cf's role in development, the distribution of its mRNA and protein in tissue sections will be examined. Definitive answers will be sought by studying two aspects of neurogenesis, cell proliferation and differentiation, in mutant and control flies in vivo. The Cf+ gene product may be involved in a specific step in catecholamine metabolism which would implicate a catecholamine derivative not only as a factor in scleroticization of the cuticle but also as a specific neural cell growth regulator in the CNS. To investigate this possibility a survey of biogenic amine pools throughout development and in specific tissue of Cf and wild type will be completed.\n",
      "a9005216 IBN $234000 Cellular adaptation to high salinity by plant cells can be reversible, indicating that the regulated expression of specific genes is controlling this adaptation. The osmotin gene is one of the most thoroughly studied genes that have altered expression during exposure of adaptation to NaCl. The overall objective of this research is to better characterize the structure and function of the osmotin gene. Gene transfer studies will be used to determine the specific physiological role of osmotin in adaptation to NaCl. Molecular techniques will also be used to examine the regulatory structure of the osmotin gene to determine the mechanisms that control its expression under natural conditions. Specifically, cis-acting DNA sequences and a transacting factor will be examined. Salinity stress is an important constraint on agricultural production, particularly in irrigated systems. The long term goal of this research is to understand the basic mechanisms involved in the process of cellular adaptation to salt by examining specific genes expressed during adaptation. Understanding of the regulatory properties of such genes will eventually lead to understanding how to manipulate salt tolerance in plants, including important crop species.\n",

      "a9005224 EAR $517 This is a multifaceted study of a fossil fauna comprising about 200 species of marine bivalve mollusks that occupied southern Florida prior to the recent ice age and that suffered heavy extinction during the ice age. This fauna is spectacularly preserved in shell beds exposed by quarrying at Sarasota. PI is mapping the shell beds over a large area. Using information about habitats of surviving species and the physical nature of the shell beds, PI has concluded that the beds represent a complex of barrier island (or spit) and lagoonal environments. Further work will allow testing of hypotheses as to how the unusual vertical sequence of shell beds developed. The fauna is the tropical component of a large marine fauna that occupied the entire East and Gulf coasts of the U.S. Components of the fauna from northern Florida to Virginia are well studied. Completing the picture by studying the tropical component will enable me to investigate geographic patterns of extinction and migration during the ice age. To this end, PI will complete a species- level taxonomic study of the south Florida fauna, using general museum collections, his own collections, and type specimens--and employing morphometrics where appropriate. The precise age traditionally assigned to the fauna has recently been questioned. PI will attempt to resolve the issue using radiometric dating of fossil corals and biostratigraphy based on mollusks and microfossils.\n",
      "a9005225 MCB $180000 The goal of this proposal is to examine the regulation of replication and gene expression of the tobacco mosaic virus(TMV) as a representative of viruses that express genes through subgenomic mRNAs. A series of systems has been developed that provide altered replication and altered gene expression that can be utilized to dissect mechanisms of regulation. The experimenters will focus on regulation of the 30K and coat protein genes. The regulation of replication will be examined through the use of a two component system. The promoters of the regulated genes will be dissected. The replication parameters will be determined by using variations of the 2 component system. Understanding the regulation and replication of this model virus will provide useful information relevant to other viruses that use sub genomic RNAs.\n",

The key to these measurements is the use of flexural loading, which creates an analytically determinant stress gradient within a specimen.\n",
      "a9005228 EAR $150000 We propose to carry out a systematic spectroscopic study of the crystal chemistry of iron, including investigations of oxidation, reduction, disproportionation, and partitioning of iron in mantle and core materials at elevated pressures. The principal tools will be 57Fe Mossbauer and crystal-field spectroscopy, techniques that are ideally suited to studies of iron-bearing phases. The results will be correlated with vibrational spectra measured by Raman scattering and infrared absorption spectroscopy. The multi-anvil apparatus at SUNY Stony Brook, and diamond-anvil cell and piston-cylinder apparatus at the Geophysical Laboratory will be used for their complimentary pressure range and experimental conditions. Spectra will also be studied as a function of pressure in diamond-anvil cells. We shall map the P-T-fO2 conditions of the graphite/diamond buffer to lower mantle pressures with the piston-cylinder apparatus and the multi-anvil device and at ultrahigh pressure with the diamond-anvil cell. The results will be used to enlarge the existing thermodynamic database for iron-bearing mantle and core materials, which is crucial for modelling the mineralogy, chemical composition, and oxidation state of the deep interior.\n",

      "a9005232 EAR $55700 This is study of magmatic processes occurring at crust and mantle levels in volcanic arcs using 238U and 232Th decay series systematics. Part of the funding will be used to complete ongoing projects that focus on the processes and lengths of time required to generate and accumulate rhyolite in Cascade arc volcanoes. The volcanoes that are being studied (medicine Lake and Crater Lake) have erupted silicic magmas in the Holocene, and are well-known geologically and geochemically through the work of U.S.G.S. collaborators. Approximately 6-9 months will be necessary to complete the analyses of whole rocks and contained mineral phases for nuclide activities, to determine magma residence times with open-system modeling techniques, and to write up the results. The remainder of the 2-year study period will be used to investigate the origin of mafic magmas that are the geochemical and thermal parents of Central American arc magma systems. We will analyze 20-25 rocks from the Central American arc and sediments from the Cocos Plate for 238U-230Th-226Ra-232Th activities. These same rocks are being analyzed by other scientists for 10Be/Be ratios, Sr, Nd, and Pb isotopic ratios, and B, trace element, and major element concentrations. The goal is to delineate the nature of the subducting slab component in Central American arc magmas, the way it becomes involved in arc magma genesis, and the time scales required for magma generation and transport.\n",
      "a9005233 MCB $194642 Volvox carteri is a potentially powerful model for analyzing the genetic control of cellular differentiation and morphogenesis. Each individual contains two entirely different cell types that exhibit a complete division of labor between vegetative and reproductive functions, and that are arranged in a highly regular pattern within a simple spheroid. Because the organism is haploid and reproduces rapidly in the asexual cycle, individuals possessing mutations affecting key developmental processes are readily isolated, and grown into large, genetically homogeneous populations. But because the organism can be switched from asexual to sexual reproduction at will, formal genetic analysis is also possible. Our objective is to make the genetic linkage map of Volvox more useful for future developmental- and molecular-genetic studies, by extending it to include additional drug-resistance markers, restriction fragment length polymorphisms and rearrangement breakpoints. And, as a major step toward elucidating the genetic programs that regulate differentiation of reproductive cells, we will attempt to identify and map all of the loci at which mutations either result in a breakdown of the division of labor between somatic and reproductive cells, or result in constitutive sexual reproduction. Volvox bridges the gap between single-celled chlamydomonas, and multicellular higher plants. Therefore, basic studies of Volvox are important in evolutionary and developmental studies.***//\n",
      "a9005234 EAR $103348 The objective of this project is to construct the first comprehensive loess chronology for South Island, New Zealand. About 85-90 regions will be collected. Dating analyses in the TL laboratory in Bellingham will be conducted. This project will build upon the previous detailed testing of TL dating methods conducted by the PI on loess from North Island. Further test will be conducted on a few known-age South Island Loess samples (remote from sources of volcanic feldspars in North Island), and extensive applications of reliable partial-bleach procedures will be made to several undated key loess sections throughout South Island. The resultant loess chronology will be related to the development of associated Quaternary features such as marine terraces, glacial outwash deposits and river terraces. TL dates for such features and for several buried soils in the loess sequences will reveal the timing of environmental changes in much of South Island, in the targeted time window of 20-200 ka.\n",

      "a9005251 IBN $285000 A critical step in pattern formation in Drosophila is the establishment of polarity along the two major body axes. At least 20 maternally active genes are involved in creating dorsal- ventral polarity. A variety of experiments have shown that dorsal represents the last step in the process, it acts as the ventral morphogen relating the maternal positional information to the zygotic genome. Dr. Steward has cloned and characterized the dorsal gene and found it is closely related to the vertebrate proto-oncogene c-rel. In wild type embryos, the dorsal protein is present in the cytoplasm during cleavage. After the nuclei migrate to the periphery of the embryo, a ventral to dorsal gradient of nuclear dorsal protein is established. The formation of the nuclear gradient is disrupted in mutant embryos from other maternally active dorsal-ventral polarity genes. In dorsalized mutant embryos, only cytoplasmic protein is observed, while in ventralized embryos, the nuclear gradient is shifted dorsally. Relocalization of the dorsal protein from the cytoplasm to the nucleus appears critical for dorsal to function as a morphogen. Dr. Steward proposes a number of experiments that address the question of what genes either interact with dorsal to effect the cytoplasmic versus nuclear localization or are essential for dorsal function once the protein is in the nucleus. Specifically she will perform genetic screens to isolate second site suppressors of specific dorsal mutations.\n",
      "a9005253 MCB $309000 Transcriptional enhancers are a crucial element in eukaryotic gene expression, yet their mechanism of action is largely unknown. The Xenopus rRNA enhancer is an excellent system in which to probe enhancer mechanism because it can be easily assayed by injection into oocytes and appears to require only a small number of proteins for its activity. When the rRNA enhancer and promoter are located in trans on the opposite rings of a multiply-intertwined dimeric catenane, the enhancer augments transcription. This result strongly suggests that enhancers work by looping, and this approach can be used to further test enhancer mechanism and to better understand transcription mechanisms. To test the importance of catenane structure in trans activation, gyrase network of the promoter and enhancer, which consist of single interlinks in essentially all combinations, will be prepared and assayed for enhancer activity. The importance of enhancer topology will be tested by linearizing the enhancer after transcriptional activation. The kinetics of transcription complex formation will be examined by oocyte injection. Oligonucleotide-directed triple helix formation will be tested for its usefulness as a tool in dissecting transcriptional mechanisms. The mechanisms of enhancer action and transcription of RNA polymerase II genes in Xenopus oocytes and embryos will be investigated by defining the regulatory sequences of oocyte-specific genes and testing trans activation of an embryonic enhancer. In a complementary approach, the interaction of the transcription factor THIS with both the promoter and enhancer will be characterized in more detail. The DNasel footprint of THIS suggests that the DNA wraps around the protein. This hypothesis will be tested by determining whether a change in the linking number of a plasmid containing THIS binding site in the circular permutation assay. Enhancer mutants that have changes either in spacing between sites or promoter THIS binding sites substitution for enhancer sites will be assayed for transcription. The importance of primary sequences and DNA structure in THIS binding and bending will be explored by combining DMS protection and interference, ethylation interference and bending studies with site directed mutagenesis of the THIS binding sites. the polypeptides copurifying with THIS activity will be characterized in more detail.\n",
      "a9005259 IBN $227940 The research proposed in this application addresses basic biological questions concerning the normal functioning of the pancreatic islet in the anglerfish. This animal is ideally suited for the proposed studies since it affords the highest yield of pancreatic endocrine cells of any species currently known. The proposed studies will add significant novel insight into the anatomical distribution and also the nutrient and neurotransmitter regulation of a key enzyme (peptidyl-glycine alpha-amidating mono-oxygenase- PAM) which is involved in the post- translational processing of islet endocrine hormones. Furthermore the proposed investigations will significantly increase our understanding of the regulation of islet hormone secretion by two major neurotransmitters, norepinephrine and neuropeptide Y, which are distributed throughout the animal kingdom. The results of these studies will provide new insight into basic mechanisms of islet cell function and regulation by the nervous system in anglerfish and there is also a very high probability that these findings will be applicable to several other species.\n",

It has been demonstrated that the small proteglycan II of bone binds to the \"D\" bands of the gap region of type I collagen fibrils and controls the rate of formation and the final size of these fibers. It is not known which region of the PGII of bovine bone has been cloned and sequenced. Therefore, the gene encoding PGII will be isolated, the intron/exon structure determined and the regulatory motifs (promoter, enhancers) identified and characterized. The process of isolation will involve \"gene walking\", or utilizing sequences of one genomic clone to isolate and identify another. These overlapping clones will be mapped in detail using restriction endonucleases and synthetic oligonucleotides. The 5' donor and 3' acceptor splice sites for intron/exon boundaries will be identified, isolated and sequenced. Exon specific nucleotide sequences will be utilized to make synthetic peptides. These peptides will then be utilized to determine the locations of specific activities of the various regions of the protein (i.e. collagen binding sites). The promoter will be utilized in transformation studies of cultured bone (PGII protein producing) and kidney (non-producing) cells in the absence and presence of estrogen, vitamin D and phorbol esters. Results of these studies will identify specific structural and functional domains of the protein, and provide a means by which the regulation of expression of the PGII gene can be studied.***\n",

      "a9005290 IBN $210000 Fatty acid synthesis is required for several diverse roles in plants including an essential housekeeping function in the synthesis of membranes in every cell, and specialized developmental and organ-specific functions in the production of seed storage oils and surface protective waxes. The long term goal of this project is to understand how plants regulate fatty acid biosynthesis at both biochemical and gene expression levels to meet these diverse roles. This research provides information on three fronts: 1. Identification of the rate determining/regulatory steps which provide short term control over rates of fatty acid synthesis. 2. Examination of the structure, organization and regulation of fatty acid synthase (FAS) genes is to be done using acyl carrier protein (ACP) as a model. 3. Evaluation will be made of the possible physiological role of multiple ACP isoforms by over-expression of their genes and antisense inhibition of their expression in transgenic plants. In addition to their major role in the structure and function of all cell membranes, plant fats represent a vast renewable resource. Annual world production of plant oils is approximately 60 million metric tons with a value of more than $20 billion. In the U.S., about two-thirds of all plant oil is consumed by humans and animals. In the American diet, plant oils have gradually tended to replace animal fats and now accout for 15-20% of total calories consumed. In addition, plant oils are employed in the manufacture of a range of specialty products including lubricants, plastics and detergents. Despite the major economic and nutritional significance of plant fats, there has been comparatively little research into the regulation of their biosynthesis. This research investigates the expression of certain genes required for fat synthesis by plants as well as points of metabolic control in one specific case.***//\n",
      "a9005291 MCB $90000 Pectins are major structural polysaccharides of the cell wall in higher plants and are of enormous complexity. They have been thought to play a multiplicity of roles in the biology of the cell in connection with wall hydration, plasticity and cell adhesion. Pectins also appear to be involved in plant defense responses. This project will examine some of the detailed modifications in chemical structure of pectins that take place during cell growth. Particular attention is to be paid to the specific type of esterification of uronic acid residues in maize cells and how this changes as the cells grow. Evidence that the esterified galactosyluronic acid units cannot be completely accounted for by methyl esters leads to the need for further work to characterize more fully these esterified compounds. This project is intended to elucidate details of esterification and how thesse may relate to polysaccharide interactions resulting from the pectin esterifications that are associated with cell enlargement. The cell wall of higher plants is largely responsible for the support of plants and is a major determinant of the form of plants. Plant cell walls comprise of a number of complex polymeric carbohydrates, including cellulose, hemicellulose and pectic compounds. Pectic compounds are polymeric compounds consisting of a series of sugar-acids that are linked together in complex patterns. These pectic compounds undergo subtle changes in their chemical structure during growth, and these changes may play an important role in determining how plant cells are able to grow in size. In this project Dr. Carpita continues his detailed exploration of the chemistry of maize pectins, making use of state-of- the-art technology in fully characterizing these important compounds.***//\n",

      "a9005299 MCB $189997 It has been shown previously that the functional state of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (GT) is determined in part by the lipid environment. Evidence obtained in the last grant period suggests that GT is an oligomer regulated by protein- protein interactions, which are modulated in turn by the lipids at the annulus. Moreover, it appears that the organization of protein-protein interactions as well as the distribution of lipids in untreated microsomes, which constrain the maximal activity of GT, is not the thermodynamically most stable state of microsomes. This metastable organization and associated constraint on the activity of microsomal enzymes seem to be general properties of microsomal enzymes in that two other enzymes studied behave like GT. This study establishes the validity of the above ideas via detailed studies of GT, glucose-6-Pase, and acylCoA ligase in microsomes and in pure, reconstituted systems. If current studies establish that pure GT is an oligomer the conditions under which it dissociates will be determined to establish the factors that account for constaint and organization in intact microsomes. Independent of these results ongoing studies are being conducted on the influence of the lipid environment on the functional state and stability of GT. This research is fundamental to our understanding of the organization and function of membrane proteins as well as the role of lipids in modulating the behavior of these proteins. Progress in this area will have an impact on basic cellular biology, biochemistry and pathobiology.***//\n",

      "a9005302 EAR $50000 This research is an extension of an ongoing project to image the subsurface geometry of active faults associated with the San Andreas system in southern California. The geometry of mapped active faults will be found by pre-stack migration of existing seismic reflection datasets. The imaged faults will be related to regional deep crustal structures and tested for evidence of Poisson's ratio variations from amplitude-versus-offset trends, suggesting tectonically-active zones of weakness. Data from the EDGE and Calcrust projects will be used to investigate the Santa Maria Basin and Tehachapi Mountains areas.

      "a9005305 INT $25686 This is a two year collaborative research project between B. Clark Burchfiel of Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Chen Jichen of the Yunnan Institute of Geological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The project is sponsored jointly by NSF and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. This is the first phase of a projected four year study on Cenozoic and active deformation in the Tonghai.Jianshui.Kunming region of Yunnan Province. The immediate goal is to document the Cenozoic deformation history of an area adjacent to the eastern margin of the Tibetan plateau, which is related to the tectonic development of the plateau and surrounding regions of China. The broadest aim of the project is to develop a better understanding of the nature of intracontinental deformation in Tibet, China and southeast Asia. Tibet is the most spectacular example of active continental collision on earth, and deformation within Tibet is commonly assumed to provide a model for convergent intracontinental deformation. However, there is little field data available for Tibet and a wide range of hypotheses have been proposed to explain its Cenozoic deformation. These various hypotheses have different .. and testable .. implications for deformation along and adjacent to the eastern margin of Tibet, so that they may perhaps be most efficiently tested by geological studies along the eastern margin of the plateau. The proposed study of the Tonghai region should provide a major addition to the sparse observational data that document the Cenozoic and active deformation of Tibet and its environs. The PI's will test their hypothesis that the thickened crust beneath the Tibetan plateau is the result of distributed north.south to northeast crustal shortening within the plateau.\n",
      "a9005306 EAR $165000 We propose to investigate the formation of discordant dunite in the Trinity and Josephine peridotites, in northern California and southern Oregon. Quantification of the degree and nature of wall rock reaction in natural examples is crucial. If wall rock reaction commonly has a significant effect, then this process may be as important as melting and crystal fractionation in the production of magmas in the mantle. We propose to test our hypothesis by measuring major and trace element compositions of pyroxene, olivine and spinel in carefully selected samples of dunite and host peridotite. We will analyze individual crystals in thin section using the election and ion microprobes at MIT and Woods Hole. Use of major and trace element data on cores of individual mineral grains to estimate parental liquid compositions, and solution of a series of mass balance equations for these elements, should provide a quantitative estimate of the relative importance of crystal fractionation and wall rock reaction in the genesis of discordant dunite.\n",
      "a9005307 EAR $41300 This project will focus on the Colorado Plateau and adjoining regions where an inferred Proterozoic-aged, peridotite root extends to a depth of approximately 80-100 km and is surrounded by rifted continental lithosphere. Abundant samples of the upper mantle occur in volcanic rocks on and off the Colorado Plateau, and some mineral phases in these xenoliths record the recent compositional history of the lithosphere. Trace element abundances (REE,Ti,Zr,Hf,Sr) of mineral phases will be used to deduce the variation in the bulk composition of the lithosphere vertically and laterally, the nature of the phases involved in recent magmatic or metasomatic events, the nature of any trace element fractionations (e.g., REE/HFSE) coincident with these events, and the timing of these events from modelling of zoning profiles. Principal analytical tools will be the ion and electron microprobes for in situ analysis of trace and major elements.\n",
      "a9005308 MCB $265000 Plant photomorphogenesis is a complex developmental process under the control of at least three distinct photoreceptors and involving differential gene expression in both nuclear and organellar genomes. During this process a characteristic \"greeting\" of place. We are interested in understanding the biochemical and molecular genetic control of chlorophyll formation in higher plants. We have identified cDNAs and/or cloned genomic sequences encoding three enzymes of the chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway. These enzymes participate in this pathway either as regulatory (e.g., NADPH- protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (PCR) or non-rate-limiting steps (e.g., ALA-dehydratase (ALAD), PBG deaminase (PBGD) and are thought to be under phytochrome-mediated photoregulation either in a positive manner (ALAD), a negative manner (PCR), or to be unaffected by light (PBGD). We propose to continue our characterization of the structure, complexity, and organization of the gene families that encode these three chloroplast proteins. The expression characteristics of the individual family members will be analyzed with respect to light, extent of plastid differentiation and cell type. Since substantial evidence supporting the presence of a dual pathway for tetrapyrrole formation in higher plants exists, we will determine whether individual members of these gene families give rise to proteins localized in different subcellular compartments (chloroplastic versus cytosolic) and if so, whether members of a gene family giving rise to proteins compartmentalized in different subcellular locations are under different regulatory programs. Green plants produce chlorophyll both in response to light in their environment, and as part of their own normal developmental processes. The control of chlorophyll biosynthesis is complex, but poorly understood. This is a proposal to elucidate that control.***\n",
      "a9005316 MCB $135000 The hypothesis that lipopolysaccharide interacts with liver nonparenchymal cells producing an intercellular chemical mediator(s) which can interact with liver parenchymal cells increasing their fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (Fru 2,6-P2) concentration and phosphofructokinase activity is strongly supported by preliminary data and published investigations. The presence of these intercellular chemical mediator(s) is being established by determining whether addition of lipopolysaccharide to isolated rat liver Kupffer cells (macrophages) produces a factor(s) in the medium that mediates Fru 2,6-P2 concentration and phosphfructokinase activity in cultures of rat liver parenchymal cells. To test the possibility that the intercellular mediator formed by the nonparenchymal cells is a lipid, inhibitors of cyclooxygenase, lipoxygenase, and arachidonate released from membrane phospholipids are being used. The possibility that the factor secreted into the conditioned medium is a cytokine is also being tested by removing individual cytokines from the conditioned medium with specific antibodies. The effects of specific lipids and cytokines in the conditioned medium on parenchymal cell responses is being confirmed by direct testing using authentic compounds. Intercellular mediators formed as a result of incubation of lipopolysaccharide with Kupffer cells are being identified and any unique factor(s) which affect regulation of parenchymal cell Fru 2,6-P2 concentration and phosphofructokinase activity will be isolated and the chemical structure identified. Liver parenchymal cells (hepatocytes) comprise over 90% of the liver by mass and are the site of principal metabolic functions associated with the liver. The liver also contains non- parenchymal cells which comprise approximately 35% of the liver by cell number. In response to a variety of stimuli, these non- parenchymal cells synthesize and secrete biologically active lipids and peptides. The importance of these locally released peptide and lipid factors as intracellular communicators which regulate and amplify specific physiological processes has been suggested for many years. Recent studies have now implicated intra-organ communication between parenchymal and non-parenchymal cells. Evidence suggests that non-parenchymal cell mediate regulation of parenchymal cell carbohydrate metabolism. This research examines this phenomenon with the intent of increasing our understanding of how liver carbohydrate metabolism (an essential life function) is regulated.\n",
      "a9005321 ATM $338284 This is a study of the reactions of atmospheric nitrogen compounds with components of airborne sea salt, and of the chemistry of the gaseous products of these reactions. It is designed to clarify questions of atmospheric composition in coastal regions and of the possible impact of there reactions on tropospheric ozone in the Arctic. Laboratory studies will be conducted to measure the absolute kinetics of the reactions of HNO3, NO2 and N2O5 with NaCl and NaBr. Whether these reactions continue to occur when the salts are dissolved in ice will also be determined and compared to the reactions of HBr in ice. The photochemistry of the newly discovered gaseous BrNO2 and the atmospherically relevant kinetics and mechanisms of reaction of ClNO2 will also be determined. The results of these experimental studies will then be used to quantitatively assess the importance of these heterogeneous gas-solid reactions in the chemistry of regional polluted areas, as well as remote areas such as the Arctic.\n",

      "a9005330 MCB $240000 The primacy of ATP for the energization of primary ion transport is universally accepted. Cation-translocating ATPases, capable of pumping H+, Na+, K+ and Ca2+, have been found in virtually all living cells and are recognized to be of paramount importance for cellular function. One notable exception, however, is the H+- translocating inorganic pyrophosphatase (H+-PPase) of higher plant vacuolar membrane (tonoplast) which utilizes inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi), instead of ATP, as energy source. This enzyme, the first example of a PPi-dependent H+ pump in any \"non- energy coupling\" membrane, is a major vacuolar membrane component and capable of generating a H+-electrochemical potential difference of +200mV. The tonoplast PPase is therefore quantitatively significant at both the protein and functional levels and amenable to molecular characterization. This research provides for (i) the determination of the amino acid sequence of the Mr64,000 substrate-binding subunit of the enzyme, and (ii) the enumeration of the components constituting the functionally integral pump and elucidation of their respective roles. Objective (i) provides insights into the evolutionary origins of this novel translocase and facilitate the modeling of its organization on the membrane. Objective (ii), on the other hand, provides an independent test of the models derived from the sequence data and facilitate identification of the structural elements responsible for mediating both substrate hydrolysis and H+-translocation. The ubiquity of the tonoplast PPase in plant cells and the unique status of PPi as the limiting case of a high energy phosphate will make the results obtained of broad bioenergetic significance. The vacuolar membrane (tonoplast) of higher plant cells contains an enzyme called a H+-translocating inorganic pyrophosphatase. This enzyme is ubiquitous in higher plants and contributes to the establishment and maintenance of a transmembrane electrochemical potential difference. This electrochemical potential difference, in turn, is necessary for the transport of other solutes. Since little is known about this important enzyme, studies are being carried out to obtain knowlegde of its evolutionary origins, organization and physiological functions.\n",

      "a9005333 EAR $94000 PIs will investigate the tectonic setting, magmatic originand stratigraphic significance of altered volcanic ash beds (K.bentonites) in the Middle and Upper Ordovician strata ofBaltoscandia and to compare these data with similar data fromNorth America. Preliminary studies strongly suggest these K.bentonite beds on both sides of lapetus had a common source and acommon tectonic setting. If this indication proves correct, themost widespread of these beds will have profound event.stratigraphic implications for the Ordovician, and ourunderstanding of Laurentia and Baltica plate positions during theTaconian orogeny will be substantially improved. Similarly, theabundance of Silurian K.bentonites throughout Baltoscandia andthe UK indicates ongoing plate.margin volcanism from Llandoverythrough Ludlow time. PIs will collect samples of the mostextensive beds from cores and outcrops in Estonia, Sweden andNorway. They will add to existing information on thebiostratigraphic position of these beds and use chemicalfingerprinting of both bulk samples and selected phenocrysts tomake accurate correlations with North American beds. These willbe compared with trans.Atlantic stratigraphic relations of K.bentonites suggested by traditional biostratigraphy and bygraphic correlation using conodonts. We will also obtain high.resolution Ar age spectra and U.Pb dates from biotite and zirconseparates from biostratigraphically well.constrained K.bentonitesthat will add key ages to the Ordovician time scale.

      "a9005344 EAR $77228 The sedimentary and volcaniclastic rocks of the Oligocene Creede Formation will be investigated in order to assess the range and evolution of intracaldera sedimentary environments, and the controls on diagenesis and alteration in an intracaldera setting. The Creede Formation was chosen for this study because of the extensive exposures of relatively underformed intracaldera sedimentary rocks associated with a large resurgent caldera, the well known volcanic stratigraphy and chronology of the Creede area, and the opportunity to test and contribute to the well-studied Creede hydrothermal model. In contrast to previous studies of intracaldera sedimentary rocks, this study will focus on evaluating the basin-wide field relationships among sedimentary, primary pyroclastic, and hydrothermal rocks, as well as authigenic mineral chemistry and distribution. These data will be used to: 1) develop an understanding of depositional processes and sediment distribution patterns occurring in an intracaldera basin; and 2) assess the relative controls of the depositional environment, hydrothermal activity, organic carbon distribution, and basin hydrology on the diagenesis of the volcaniclastic rocks. The results of this project will provide a working model for sedimentary deposition and diagenesis in an intracaldera setting, as well as allow an assessment of the role the Creede Formation sediments may have played in the evolution of the Creed hydrothermal system. In general, the results will contribute to our understanding of caldera evolution and hydrothermal systems associated with calderas, and provide valuable baseline data for evaluation of other intracaldera sedimentary sequences.\n",
      "a9005345 MCB $278616 Rhythmic biological phenomena which occur at approximately 24 h intervals in the absence of environmental time cues are termed circadian rhythms. Two basic questions about circadian rhythms concern the mechanisms by which: 1) time information is used to regulate biological phenomena observed to be rhythmic, and 2) time is measured. To address the former, genes have been identified whose expression is regulated in a circadian fashion in Arabidopsis thaliana. Elements will be characterized that are required, in cis or in trans, for this circadian regulation using gene fusion, gel retardation and DNA protection strategies. The mechanism of time measurement will be addressed through the identification and characterization of mutations which disrupt biological timekeeping. The circadian rhythm in nitrate reductase will be explored to see if the protein expression and mRNA levels correspond. If they do correspond, nitrate reductase levels will be measured in an attempt to screen for circadian regulation mutations. Fusion genes, in which clock control is conferred on a reporter gene will be used as molecular tags on the biological clock in screens designed to identify mutations which affect clock function. The circadian rhythm in stomatal apertures will be used to select mutants in which circadian regulation is altered. Characterization of these mutations will identify elements either of the clock itself or of the regulatory system by which time control is exerted. *** //\n",
      "a9005353 IBN $257971 Pancreas and intestine from the painted turtle (Chrysemys picta) will serve as models for investigating insulin secretion in two diffuse endocrine systems. Chrysemys lacks the compact, highly ordered islet common to most other vertebrates and exhibits (as do other turtles) a substantial population of intestinal insulin cells a condition which is virtually unique among vertebrates. Constituent pancreatic endocrine cell population will be determined morphometrically to assess relationships among cell types with respect to sex, season and distribution within the pancreas. The Chrysemys pancreas also will be examined at the ultrastructural level to further characterize the endocrine cell types using conventional electron microscopy and EM immunocytochemistry. The morphological basis for peptidergic regulation of insulin secretion will be determined immunocytochemically at the light and EM level. Perifused trypsin-dispersed intestinal mucosa cells enriched for B cells will be used for characterizing intestinal cell secretory function. Attempts will be made to determine in regulation on intestinal insulin secretions in vivo and the proportional contribution made by the pancreas and intestine to circulating insulin. Results from these studies will provide important basic information on insulin secretion from the endocrine pancreas and gut of Chrysemys, two diffuse endocrine systems which are atypical among vertebrates. Moreover, these investigations may provide important insights into the evolution of the vertebrate gastro-entero pancreatic endocrine systems and into the importance of local (paracrine) regulation of endocrine function.\n",
      "a9005354 EAR $117940 This research will further develop a three-dimensional chronostratigraphic framework of a carbonate platform, and, secondly, to extract a platform flooding history (relative sea level curve) from a high energy, windward bank margin. The extremely successful magnetostratigraphic dating of four 60-m cores from Little Bahama Bank is beginning to unravel the nature of platform deposition. This dating technique has renewed interest and understanding of carbonate platform depositional models and has extended age control beyond the Late Pleistocene and Holocene. The new Little Bahama Bank chronostratigraphy reveals a considerably different depositional sequence than proposed from just lithostratigraphy. This project will complete the remaining cores from the platform and extend downward the existing reversal stratigraphy to achieve the first three-dimensional platform history. The second part of this project will consist of dating three cores from the eastern side of Great Bahama Bank, part of a high-energy/bank interior facies that preserves a record of platform flooding (regional sea level curve) events.\n",

      "a9005374 MCB $300000 The long term objective of this proposal is to provide a precise definition of phospholipase A2 activation in thermodynamic, kinetic, and structural terms. This definition is important in developing an understanding of the functioning and regulation of the enzyme and the nature of catalysis at membrane interfaces. The proposed work will focus on understanding the putative structural changes leading to full activation. This work will include definition of the interfacial regions and enzyme- substrate interaction locus and the evaluation of specific sites of interaction in thermodynamic, kinetic and structural terms. An important aspect of the proposed work will be thermodynamic characterization of protein-protein interaction and calcium binding in aqueous solution. Such characterization is necessary to design and interpret kinetic experiments aimed at defining the temporal sequence of events of the activation process. This project will initially focus on the properties of three naturally occurring enzymes, phospholipase A2 from porcine pancreas, from a rattlesnake, and from the water moccasin. The principle technique to obtain structural information about phospholipases will be nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Reaction microcalorimetry, differential scanning calorimetry, pH stat techniques, fluorescence spectroscopy, and high pressure liquid chromatography will also be extensively used to characterize these systems. In addition, site specific mutagenesis of synthetic phospholipase genes will be used perturb protein interaction sites.\n",
      "a9005376 EAR $100000 Fluids and fluid flow are important parameters in the deformation of accretionary prisms and in the formation of melanges. Stratigraphically controlled fluid pathways are destroyed early in the evolution of accretionary prisms and therefore fault-zone melanges, with their associated fracture permeability, must be important during the long-term fluid loss in accretionary prisms. This study will utilize melange zones in the developing accretionary complex of the Olympic Peninsula, Washington. These melanges are currently leaking hydrocarbon rich fluids and include cements and veins that attest to their role as paleo-fluid conduits. Results of various types of data will be applied to the goal of defining the nature and variation of fluid flow and composition, its interrelationship with the structural history, and the affects of both on the thermal evolution of an accretionary complex.\n",
      "a9005379 IBN $234720 The long range goal of this research is to elucidate the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which the phytohormone ethylene regulates development in higher plants, specifically the activation of genes during ethylene-induced ripening of fruit. A number of ripening-induced genes including a cytochrome P-450 oxidase have been identified. This ripening-induced P-450 is the first plant P-450 to be characterized at the molecular level and is designated cyp71A1. The functional role of the cytochrome P- 450 in ripening fruit is unknown and is one of the primary objectives of the research proposed. In addition, cellular and genetic regulatory elements responsible for P-450 gene activation during ripening are being identified. The specific objectives are: (1) characterize the substrate specificity of the cyp71A1 gene product in a heterologous expression system, (2) identify the cis-acting elements that confer ethylene regulation on the cyp71A1 gene through transient expression assays of modified promoter/reporter constructs, and (3) characterize potential trans-acting factors which specifically bind to the upstream elements of the cyp71A1 gene. This research begins to unravel the series of biochemical events leading to ripening in avocado. Ripening is a poorly understood process of enormous economic importance in agriculture, as well as an excellent model system for how hormones affect genes espression.\n",

The Wrangellia-Alexander superterrane is one of the best documented microcontinents in the western Cordillera, yet little is known of its tectonic and depositional history immediately prior to its Cretaceous accretion. This project is a detailed study of the provenance and sedimentology of the Seymour Canal Formation of the Gravina belt, and Jura-Cretaceous sequence of flysch and volcanic rocks deposited on the inboard slope of the Wrangellia-Alexander microcontinent prior to final closure, in order to constrain the nature of this collision. The project will focus on little-metamorphosed portions of the Gravina belt, and carry out petrographic studies of sandstones and conglomerate clasts, coupled with mineral chemistry studies of plagioclase and clinopyroxene in sandstones and igneous rocks to establish provenance and tectonic setting. It will integrate turbidite lithofacies analysis and ichnofacies and paleo- current studies in order to reconstruct basin history, and refine the temporal framework of deposition by combining new microfossil biostratigraphy with radiometric dating of volcanic and detrital biotite and hornblende grains using Argon 40/39 methods. These studies will help document sedimentologic and tectonic processes operative in this microcontinent collision, and may serve as a pilot study for other, more enigmatic Jura-Cretaceous flysch basins of the Cordilleran.\n",

      "a9005388 MCB $285000 This laboratory has cloned and characterized several avirulence genes from bacterial pathogens in the Pseudomonas syringae group that are responsible for defensive surveillance by soybean plants. One of these genes, avrD from P. syringae pv. tomato, causes bacterial hosts to elaborate an extracellular elicitor compound. The isolated elicitor causes the hypersensitive response (HR) only on soybean cultivars containing thecomplementary disease resistance gene, Rpg4. AvrD also has several other interesting features such as its occurrence, along with four other linked genes, on an indigenous bacterial plasmid and its 100-fold induction when bacteria are grown in soybean leaves as compared to culture media. The interaction of bacteria carrying avrD with plant hosts therefore involves reciprocal signalling mechanisms that initiate precise developmentalprograms in both organisms. This proposal requests support to further study avrD and its role in initiating plant disease resistance by 1) characterizing the avrD elicitor; 2) elucidating the nature of plant induction of avrD; 3) studying the indigenous plasmid on which avrD occurs and 4) comparing avrD withhomologous genes that occur in other P. syringae pathovars.

Using a variety of historic demographic data, surveys of memorial tablets and other tombstones, the investigator will try to establish when the \"stem\" family system became prevalent in Japan. This research is important because the history of Japan since the Seventeenth Century has been one of impressive economic and political growth.

The specific goals of these studies are to determine the Os isotopic mantle growth curve; to determine the source of cratonic core rocks; to understand the behavior of Re and Os in igneous systems; to study the formation of the subcontinental mantle and to investigate recycling of oceanic crust within the upper mantle and the role of oceanic crust in island arc volcanism. The Re-Os isotopic system has unique potential to contribute to geochemical studies of the Earth. This system provides new information complementary to that available from the Rb-Sr, SM-Nd and U-Th-Pb systems for several reasons: both Re and Os are siderophile elements, Os is compatible in the mantle while Re generally is incompatible, Os has a relatively high abundance in the mantle compared to the crust and the melting events that form basaltic rocks strongly fractionate Os from Re. The use of the Re-Os isotopic system will provide a greater understanding of the depleted and enriched reservoirs of the convecting mantle and the lithosphere, the creation of ancient continental crust with its lithospheric roots and the role of subducted slab components at convergent margins.\n",
      "a9005414 EAR $64900 Modeling of continental crustal evolution requires improved understanding of lower crustal rock types, compositions, and structure. Recent geophysical transects in the Basin and Range and the Basin and Range-to-Colorado Plateau (BR-CP) transition zone have raised questions about the nature and development of the lower crust and the crust-mantle boundary in this region. Flat Moho topography beneath the Basin and Range, and multiple, sub-horizontal Moho reflectors beneath the Basin and Range and the BR-CP transition zone have lead to suggestions that basaltic underplating played an important role in the development of the Basin and Range lower crust and crust-mantle boundary during Cenozoic extension. Xenoliths from Wikieup, Arizona provide actual rock samples from the crust-mantle boundary beneath the BR-CP transition zone. This xenolith suite includes abundant composite nodules of upper mantle peridotite in contact with lower crustal gabbro and granulite. Complete petrographic and compositional analysis (minerals, whole rock major, trace, and rare elements, isotopes) will be used to determine the petrogenesis of lower crustal rock types. Xenolith thermobarometry will provide estimates of the thermal state of the lower crust in this region. Integration of complete petrologic data with existing geophysical data will allow evaluation of the role of processes such as basaltic underplating in the evolution of the Basin and Range lower crust and the development of the crust-mantle boundary.\n",

At the same time, computer simulations on supercomputers are gaining prominence in the earth sciences. The research described below is a collaborative effort between D.A. Yuen and F.J. Spera in the molecular modeling of molten germania (GeO2). The principal aim is to attempt to explain the properties of GeO2 melt, a classic network structure fluid, on the basis of intermolecular forces. Because GeO2 is an excellent analog of network silicate melts relevant to high temperature (e.g., molten SiO2, NaAlSl2O6) and is potentially easier to simulate using molecular dynamics, a greater understanding of the chemical bonding, thermodynamic and transport properties of molten GeO2 will help in turn to understand silicates better.\n",

Although iron is abundant in the soil, the acquisition of iron is problematic due to its low solubility at biological pH under aerobic conditions. The study of iron acquisition as it pertains to economically important symbioses is directed at answering three questions: 1) how do rhizobial cells acquire iron as free-living microorganisms where they must compete for this nutrient with other soil inhabitants 2) how do rhizobia acquire iron as symbionts and 3) does iron regulate gene expression? Studies are continuing on the utilization of the siderophores citrate, ferrichrome and rhodoturulate as iron sources by B. japonicum as well as on the iron regulation of genes involved in iron uptake. This research: 1) further characterizes biochemically the acquisition of iron by both free-living and symbiotic cells of B. japonicum, 2) identifies and characterizes genes involved in iron acquisition, including those which encode iron-inducible outer membrane proteins, and 3) investigates the control of gene expression by iron. The increasing world demand for protein and the increasing expense of producing nitrogen fertilizer has resulted in a widespread interest in biological nitrogen fixation. Although the nitrogen-fixing Bradyrhizobium/legume symbioses supply much of the fixed nitrogen for agriculture in the temperate regions of the world, many aspects of the symbioses are still poorly understood. The importance of iron in animal/pathogen interactions is now well established; the role of this metal in the nitrogen-fixing rhizobial/legume symbioses is just beginning to be explored. The research proposed here provides for a better understanding of the role of iron in regulating the symbiotic interaction. Such an understanding elucidates how rhizobia survive in the soil as well as how they interact with their plant host to establish an effective symbiosis. This is essential to any efforts to engineer a better symbiosis and for the ultimate extension of the symbiosis to other plant hosts.\n",
      "a9005432 EAR $46000 A central concept in evolution is the escalation of biotic interaction over geologic time. Among the most testable of escalation hypotheses is the \"bulldozing hypothesis:\" accelerating bioturbation caused a commensurate decline of non- locomotive taxa living on unconsolidated substrata. The changing intensity of bioturbation can change the rock record, altering taphonomy, sedimentology and stratigraphic resolution. PI will test the bulldozing hypothesis for a critical interval of geologic time. Data covers 7 time intervals (formations) and 3 shelf environments. PI will gather quantitative data on lighology, ichnology and body fossils from >1200 samples via bed by bed logging of 400-500 m of Silurian and Devonian carbonates and siliciclastics in New York and Pennsylvania during 6 person-months of field work. The interval (Wenlockian-Eifelian) spans some 40 million years, during which preliminary work indicates that ecologically significant bioturbation first affected the Appalachian Basin. This is the first study to test the association between bioturbation and vulnerable body fossils. These data will also document cross- shelf environmental trends of bioturbation during the study interval.\n",
      "a9005436 DMS $27000 Work on this project focuses on two general areas of harmonic analysis. The first concerns stability of Fredholm properties in interpolation scales. It is motivated by a recurring theme inthe theory of partial differential equations defined in domainswith relatively irregular boundaries (Lipschitz domains). Namely, when the operators which associate boundary values with solutions are known to be bounded in a certain Lebesgue p-norm say the quadratic - then they turn out to be bounded across alarger range of values of p. The work to be done involves extensions of 'stability range' to larger classes of operators on Banach spaces. Goals include finding upper bounds for the length of the range and reducing assumptions currently in force regarding the dimension of the null space of the operators. The second line of investigation relates to efforts extending classical results on Rademacher and Walsh series, especially in the context of series with large gaps. It is known that in such circumstances, the quadratic norm the coefficients of a series is bounded by the maximum norm of the sum of the series. If the series involved are trigonometric, then the maximum norm must be replaced by p-norms. Recent results have extended the classical comparisons to include the bounded mean oscillation norm. Work will now be done to obtain more general BMO estimates for the same type of problem where the series are restricted to measurable sets rather than intervals. The first hurdle to be overcome is that of drafting a proper definition of BMO for sets of functions defined on other than intervals. Support for this project will be restricted to graduate student stipends and travel allowance.\n",
      "a9005444 EAR $65200 This is an isotopic and geochemical investigation of calcite cements in the post-Miocene sequence of Enewetak Atoll. Preliminary carbon and oxygen isotope data from microsamples of calcite cements within the Pliocene sequence of Core KAR-1 at Enewetak Atoll indicate that these cements were emplaced in meteoric phreatic lenses, while 87Sr/86Sr data places these diagenetic events in the Pleistocene and Pliocene. The position of paleophreatic lenses associated with these cements can provide quantitative estimates of Pleistocene sea-level lowstands. A combination of stable and radiogenic isotope data are needed form calcite cements from Core KAR-1 and from age-equivalent sediments of Core OOR-17 to discriminate cement phases related to successive and temporally separate paleophreatic lenses and to assess the stratigraphic distribution of individual phreatic cement zones. This \"chemical cement\" stratigraphy will allow multiple episodes of phreatic cementation to be identified and their distribution documented. Thus, this study offers an opportunity to: 1) better understand the dynamics of the meteoric diagenetic system during times of high frequency sea-level change, and 2) directly estimate the magnitude of Pleistocene sea-level lowstands by monitoring the position of paleophreatic lenses. Ultimately this new sea level record can be used to calibrate the records of sequence stratigraphy and foraminiferal delta 18O stratigraphy to sea level.\n",
      "a9005448 CCR $450000 This project is concerned with the design of algorithms and programming environments for parallel computer systems containing large numbers of interconnected processors. The goals are to develop some of the generic algorithmic techniques that users of such systems will require, to determine what primitive operations should be included in a high-level parallel programming language, and to solve some of the algorithmic problems that will arise in the implementation of such primitive operations. The operations of particular interest relate to set-oriented data structures and combinatorial search. The approach to the efficient implementation of these operations uses ideas from randomized load balancing, parallel tree search and dynamic tree embedding. In order to support high-level parallel programming, efficient algorithms for sorting in the presence of faulty processors, message routing and synchronization control are also investigated.\n",
      "a9005460 IBN $300000 An mRNA has been identified which encodes a protein (SpEGF2) containing four domains related to epidermal growth factor and which accumulates at the onset of morphogenesis in developing sea urchin embryos (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus). Dr. Angerer's hypothesis is that this protein, or peptides derived from it, function as a signaling factor secreted into the blastocoel. SpEGF2 protein contains a hydrophobic leader, lacks a transmembrane domain and is very similar to short, blastocoelic peptides found in another sea urchin species (Anthocidaris crassispina) that cause a specific developmental abnormality, exogastrulation, when added to cultures of embryos of either genus. The developmental function in sea urchin embryogenesis of the SpEGF2 peptide receptor signaling system will be investigated using techniques of molecular genetics, immunology, biochemistry and experimental embryology. Targets of SpEGF2 function will be identified by 1) using anti-SpEGF2 antibodies, 2) binding labeled synthetic or endogenous SpEGF2 peptide(s) to cells of the embryo and 3) determining which cells express the SpEGF2 receptor mRNA and peptide. Finally, the effects of blocking the activity of the SpEGF2/SpEGF2-receptor signaling system on morphogenesis, cell division, and tissue specific gene expression in intact embryos will be analyzed.\n",
      "a9005468 IBN $259000 During the past several years Dr. Grainger has been investigating the mechanisms of determination of the lens during embryogenesis. This system provides an excellent general model for the study of vertebrate cell determination because it has been possible to carefully study all of the stages of the determination process. This process has been found to require several inductive interactions, and recent evidence argues that lens determination is tightly coupled to formation of the eye rudiment during gastrulation. This finding has prompted the initiation of studies on eye formation as a complement to work on lens induction. In this proposal experiments are described to continue analysis of gene regulation in this system, addressing three levels of gene expression that are important in lens and eye formation in Xenopus, from terminal differentiation to the initial stages of determination. First, the regulation of cell type specific proteins in these two tissues will be examined: primarily crystallin gene regulation in the lens and opsin gene regulation in the eye rudiment. Second, several cDNA screening procedures will be pursued for identifying gene products which may regulate the early stages of lens and eye determination, or which may serve as markers of these early stages. Characterization of several gene products which have already been identified in these screens will continue. Finally, an experimental approach is proposed for identifying gene products that may control the very precisely regulated ability, or competence, of ectoderm to respond to inductive signals that initiate the events lens and eye determination. While evidence has been accumulating about the molecular genetic controls which govern organization of many regions of the vertebrate embryo, there is virtually no information about how the eye and lens regions are established early in development. A long range goal is to construct and test models for these early processes.\n",

In an actual thrust system fault characteristics vary from fault to fault and from one place to the next along and across strike, reflecting changes in mechanics of the fault system and variations of conditions within individual fault zones. This research will address the complexities of fault deformation in the Mountain City Window of Tennessee, and the along-strike variations of fault zones and how these variations in fault behavior have influenced the overall geometry of the thrust system. Results will contribute to developing more realistic models for thrust development.\n",

These studies will enable constraints to be placed on the speciation and total halide contents of hydrothermal fluids based on known compositions of silicate minerals. In addition, it will be possible to predict how F and Cl partitioned between minerals and aqueous fluids during water-rock interactions and whether this partitioning is important in the generation of F-rich ore deposits. The most important aspects of this work are the retrieval of the thermodynamic properties of fluoride and chloride end-member minerals from published experimental studies, and the application of these results to geologic problems. The scope of the research will be limited to these aspects.\n",

      "a9005495 EAR $132878 Compressional and extensional stages accompanying continental margin tectonics are commonly sequential and may be linked by underlying processes. Recent field and laboratory studies indicate that the high-grade metamorphism in the Darwin complex of the Andes of Terra del Fuego accompanied crustal thickening that resulted from the inversion of the Rocas Verdes marginal basin by obduction of the basin floor onto the South American continent. The uplift resulted from tectonic denudation of the overthickened crust in the latest Cretaceous or earliest Cenozoic. This project will involve a test of this hypothesis by assembly of a structural transect across Cordillera Darwin and development of a model for the evolution of the southernmost Andes in relation to their plate tectonic setting.\n",

      "a9005512 MCB $113000 The project's goal is to use a new approach to simplify the kinetic and thermodynamic study of human erythrocyte glucose-6- phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) that involves the control of the enzyme's state of association. G6PD is a key enzyme in the hexosemonophosphate pathway and over 370 genetic variants of the human erythrocyte enzyme have been identified. Individuals with G6PD deficiencies can suffer hemolytic crisis on exposure to a variety of drugs or foods. The large number of genetic variants, many with reduced activity, mae G6PD an attractive target for cloning and sequencing. The interpretation of the changes in amino acid sequence are dependent on the measurement of G6PD's biochemical properties. Unfortunately, there is a lack of agreement on many of the basic enzymatic properties of erythrocyte G6PD, namely, the binding of substrates and the effect of intercellular molecules on the enzyme's kinetics. In analogy with prior work on yeast G6PD, this proposal's hypothesis is past kinetic and thermodynamic studies of human erythrocyte G6PD measured the properties of a mixture of G6PD dimers and tetramers, each of which may have different biochemical properties. This lack of agreement concerning human erythrocyte G6PD's biochemical properties would arise because the relative amounts of G6PD dimers and tetramers changed during the kinetic or thermodynamic measurements. Thus proposal will focus upon measuring the biochemical properties of the G6PD dimer, the form presumed to be present in the erythrocyte. The three specific aims of the RUI proposal are (1) to measure the number of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) and glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) molecules bound to G6PD and the magnitude of the association constant for these two molecules. The project will directly measure the equilibrium quantity of radioactively labeled G6P, or NADP, bound to the enzyme. The proposal will also (2) quantitatively study the inhibition of erythrocyte G6PD kinetics by ATP and 2,3 diphosphoglycerate, two proposed physiologically important inhibitors of G6PD. The third (3) specific aim will measure the dimertetramer association constant using large zone (plateau) HPLC experiments on a size exclusion column.\n",

Although considerable SH data show evidence of anomalous structure up to 350 km above the core- mantle boundary, to this date only European WWSSN data and the GRF array have been searched successfully to find the P-wave analog produced by such an anomaly. The results should give information on what kind of structure is giving rise to the anomalous observations which can, in turn, constrain dynamical models of the mantle and core.\n",
      "a9005514 IBN $321727 When females of the parasitic wasp Biosteres longicaudatus lay their eggs in larvae of the Caribbean fruit fly, Anastrepha suspensa they also introduce viruses into the blood of the host insect. In addition, a new protein appears in the blood of the parasitized larvae within 2-3 days after parasitization but is absent from unparasitized individuals. The numbers of parasite larvae in a host influence the amount of the protein detected and also inhibit further development even before the parasites consume the host's tissues. Injections of the crude protein into healthy fruit fly larvae inhibit their development to the pupal stage in the same way as does superparasitism (several parasites/larvae). Thus, this parasitism-specific protein may be the direct cause of fruit fly development disruption. In this laboratory, Dr. Lawrence will purify the protein in order to identify its specific effects on the host in the hope that it can be utilized to disrupt fruit fly development and thereby suppression adult populations. In the work described in this proposal, the PI wishes to determine where and when the protein is secreted in order to extract the largest amount of the protein during the time of its maximum synthesis. The basic physiological and biochemical studies proposed in this project will help to characterize the protein and indicate how, if at all, it may be exploited as a potential tool in fruit fly developmental disruption and control. There are some indications that this parasitism-specific protein may be related to the viruses introduced with the wasp egg. Thus, the viruses themselves could potentially be cultured and the protein extracted (but this is not part of the proposed study). The Caribbean fruit fly is a pest of several tropical and subtropical fruits in Florida and parts of the Caribbean. It is a close relative of the North American apple or blueberry maggot and the notorious Mediterranean fruit fly (Medfly), a major threat to citrus in California and Florida. The Medfly and related fruit flies are attacked by parasitic wasps that are closely related to the one proposed in this study. Thus these research findings would be most relevant to these fruit fly-parasitic wasp systems. Further, since this parasite is also used in biological control programs against the Medfly in countries like Greece, the studies proposed here have application potential for fruit fly control.\n",
      "a9005515 IBN $29300 At fertilization, sperm and egg membranes fuse to deliver the paternal genome into the interior of the egg, and the egg begins development. The molecular mechanisms by which the membranes fuse and the sperm activates the egg are not well understood. This project will test the hypothesis that the portion of the sperm membrane that first contacts the egg contains molecules that mediate membrane fusion and egg activation. In starfish, this portion of the membrane covers the acrosomal process (AP). The objectives of this project are to isolate starfish APs, and to identify proteins that are unique to the AP membrane and are therefore potential bearers of fusion or agonist activities. The membrane proteins will be characterized by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and by surface labeling. The ability of the isolated APs to activate and/or fuse with denuded eggs, and to fuse with phospholipid vesicles will be tested. %%% This work will serve as a foundation for efforts to identify and isolate the sperm molecules that first act on the egg, and will increase our knowledge of the general mechanisms of membrane fusion and signal transduction.\n",
      "a9005516 EAR $93641 Sedimentary and low-grade metamorphic pelitic rocks record the occurrence, timing and magnitude of interaction with crustal fluids, but radiogenic isotopic studies of such rocks and events lead to ambiguous results due to heterogeneity of source of the key minerals, especially clay minerals. The project will combine radiogenic isotopic studies (Rb-Sr and K-Ar) with detailed characterization by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) in order to provide a firm basis of interpretation of the isotopic data. The proposal is based on a successful \"pilot project\" development of methods for Rb-Sr analysis of Gulf Coast shales that have verified \"episodic\" diagenesis by tectonically- induced fluid flow. This research will expand the studies to the full range of diagenesis - low-grade metamorphism with further studies of Gulf Coast shales, and analyses of continuous sequences across northern New York and in Wales that span the range from late diagenesis to greenschist facies metamorphism.\n",

Experimental Temperatures will range from 200oC to the upper stability limit of jarosite and natrojarosite, which is expected to be below 450oC. In addition, the partitioning of sodium and potassium between jarosite and aqueous sulfate solutions, the D fractionation between the hydroxyl sites of jarosite and water, and 18O fractionation between the jarosite hydroxyl and sulfate sites and water will be measured. These experiments, which will be conducted in standard cold-seal hydrothermal vessels at a pressure of 500 bars, are an extension of work in progress on alunite to a ferric-iron bearing system. They should improve our ability to interpret isotope data on acid-sulfate alteration, which frequently includes both alunite and jarosite. In addition, they will help to constrain the chemical and isotope systematics of jarosite at lower temperatures, and thus complement ongoing studies of jarosite at 25oC. A better understanding of the properties of jarosite at surficial conditions will be important in the study of acid-mine drainage, and also in the interpretation of natural weathering and oxidation of pyritic ore deposits.\n",
      "a9005543 MCB $306121 The cell's mechanism for regulating microtubule assembly in the cytoskeleton and mitotic apparatus during mitosis remains undefined. This laboratory has demonstrated that control of intracellular calcium is essential for mitotic regulation, and has isolated and reconstituted the mitotic apparatus calcium pump and a putative mitotic apparatus calcium channel. In collaboration with Drs. Shinya Inoue and Osamu Shimomura, Dr. Silver has succeeded in quantitative imaging of calcium with the photoprotein aequorin and single photon video imaging. The next goals of this project are to continue the enzymatic and biochemical characterization of the mitotic apparatus endomembrane calcium pump and calcium channel, to elucidate the temporal limits imposed upon regulation and coordination of pathways required for mitosis that are managed through the cell cycle clock, to elucidate the role of phospholipase activity and specific products of phospholipid metabolism in regulating intracellular calcium during mitosis, and to continue quantitative two-dimensional imaging and computational analysis of the spatially and temproally regulated transicent calcium signals that control mitosis using the photoprotein aequorin and single photon digital video light microscopy. Cell division involves the ordered remodeling of microtubule, microfilament, intermediate filament, and endomembrane arrays within the cell. The cellular mechanisms initiating and carrying out cell division (mitosis) are, as yet, not understood, but a considerable body of evidence suggests that transient elevations of intracellular free calcium are essential in signaling specific mitotic events. The goal of this research is to understand how and where in the dividing cell changes in calcium levels take place. A detailed understanding of the regulation of intracellular calcium within the mitotic apparatus will provide deeper insight into the mechanisms controlling cell division.\n",

      "a9005547 MCB $263000 The chloroplast enzyme ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) catalyzes the rate-limiting step of photosynthetic CO2 fixation, and thus limits plant productivity. Oxygenation of substrate ribulosebisphosphate leads to the loss of fixed carbon, and the competition of O2 with CO2 at the enzyme active site reduces the maximum rate of carboxylation. Genetic engineering is expected to improve carboxylation by changing the CO2/O2 specificity of the enzyme. However, there has been no rationale for accomplishing this goal. Directed mutagenesis has so far been limited to confirming the essential role of a variety of \"active-site\" residues, and the Rubisco primary and x-ray-crystal structures have failed to identify potential sites for beneficial modification. In contrast, the neoclassical genetic approach that can be pursued in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has been able to define structural regions of the chloroplast-encoded large subunit that influence the CO2/O2 specificity of the holoenzyme. A more methodical approach for the application of induced mutations is underway. Mutations are being defined by sequencing appropriate chloroplast or nuclear genes, and mutant enzymes are being characterized biochemically to correlate changes in structure with changes in function. Directed mutagenesis and chloroplast transformation are also being used to test hypotheses formulated from the study of these mutations. The photosynthetic enzyme Rubisco is present in all green plants and algae and is considered to be the most abundant protein in nature. Since it catalyzes a reaction which can limit photosynthetic CO2 fixation and, therefore, plant growth, the long-term objective of this work is to make a better Rubisco. Since the primary structure of the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii Rubisco is quite similar to that of plants, it is a good model for defining potential modifications in crop-plant Rubisco enzymes.\n",

The three areas of emphasis include the study of modifications of stochastic approximation methods to insure that a point of global rather than local minimum is approached, the study of stochastic approximations in the case of dependent errors (that is, errors that do not form something close to a martingale), and the study of finite sample behavior of stochastic approximation methods.\n",
      "a9005556 MCB $259045 This research will build on recent experimental and theoretical discoveries concerning lipid monolayers at the air-water interface, discoveries based in large part on the use of epifluorescence microscopy. The objective of this research is to exploit further these microscopic techniques so as to detect with ultrahigh sensitivity physical, chemical, photochemical and biochemical events that occur at this interface. Topics of special relevance to this overall objective include the investigation of the structural properties of molecules (for example peptides) that affect the free energy along boundaries between lipid domains, molecular events that modify the local monolayer pressure and photochemical reactions involving attack of reactive oxygen species on lipids and other surface active molecules. Biochemical events of special interest include studies of lipases that selectively attack molecules at domain boundaries, and molecular events relevant to cell-cell recognition, and virus-cell recognition. Experiments will be conducted to see if the shapes, and shape transitions of lipid domains can be used to detect products derived from microlectorphoresis. From a long-term point of view these experiments may lead to new techniques for detecting, and manipulating small numbers of molecules, especially biological macromolecules.\n",

      "a9005562 OPP $26687 The Antarctic is currently experiencing a thirty to fifty percent springtime loss of its stratospheric ozone layer, resulting in a least a several-fold increase in UVB (280-320nm) radiation reaching the surface of the Southern Ocean. In spite of low solar elevation and persistent cloud cover, the magnitude of ultraviolet radiation fluence rates now experienced in polar regions roughly approaches that routinely measured in tropical latitudes. Perhaps more importantly, biologically damaging UVB radiation has increased in the Antarctic while both UVA (320- 400nm) and photosynthetically available radiation (PAR, 400- 700nm) have remained unchanged. This collaborative project will use recently developed improvements in atmospheric modeling and in-water UV and visible spectroradiometers to conduct a field study during austral spring 1990. The day-to-day variations in the magnitude and ratio of UVB:UVA:PAR irradiance incident on and penetrating the euphotic zone of marginal ice edge Antarctic waters will be qualified. The impact of this increase of UV radiation on abundance, composition and vitality of the phytoplankton community during the ice-edge spring bloom will be documented. During this time, strong vertical stratification restricts the phytoplankton to the upper water column, thus creating favorable conditions for increased UVB susceptibility. Special emphasis will be placed on defining biological restraints imposed by enhanced UVB radiation and altered UVB:UVA:PAR ratios on the balance of UVB photodamage to photorepair, photoprotective and photosynthetic mechanisms operating in the water column. The overall aim is an objective test of the hypothesis that phytoplankton in Antarctic waters are adversely unfluenced by ozone depletion.\n",
      "a9005574 MCB $403000 Carotenoids are essential components of the photosynthetic apparatus of bacteria, algae and higher plants and serve critical roles in light-harvesting and protection against photosensitized oxidations. Although the roles of carotenoids in light-harvesting and photoprotection are clearly established, the details of the excited singlet and triplet energy transfer reactions required for these are poorly understood. Drs. Albrecht and Owens propose to investigate the in vivo photophysics of photosynthetic carotenoids in several bacterial and algal pigment-protein complexes. Primary emphasis will be placed on providing a mechanistic description of singlet energy transfer from carotenoids to chlorophylls. Ultrafast absorption spectroscopy will be used to study the dynamics of singlet and triplet transfer reactions and to identify heterogeneous carotenoid function. Resonance Raman techniques, including Raman excitation profiles, will be used to probe heterogeneous carotenoid functions in vivo.\n",
      "a9005579 MCB $315000 Dr. Anderson proposes to use X-ray crystallography to determine the three-dimensional structure of the restriction endonuclease R-PvuII from two crystal forms of the free enzyme already in hand that diffract X-rays to 2.5 A. He will collect data, and then screen a number of heavy atom reagents to find several isomorphous derivative crystals. Derivative data will be used in multiple isomorphous replacement or with other published techniques to calculate phases and produce an initial electron density map. Conventional methods will be used to fit a model of R-PvuII into the map and to refine the structure. Cocrystals of R-Pvull will be grown with oligodeoxynucleotides carrying its recognition site, to solve the structure of the protein-DNA complex. Dr. Anderson will crystallize and determine the structure of catalytic and binding mutants of R-PvuII, provided by the collaborators, both in the presence and the absence of DNA. The proposed work will permit a detailed study of the structure-function relationship of R-PvuII, and will contribute significantly to the understanding of R-PvuII, of restriction enzymes, and of protein-DNA interactions.\n",
      "a9005580 MCB $316000 Mammalian cytochrome c oxidase (COX) consists of 13 subunits: three encoded in mitochondrial DNA and 10 in nuclear DNA. Long- term goals are to understand the regulation of this critically important enzyme complex through analysis of the genetic regulatory sequences controlling expression of COX nuclear genes. Short term goals include defining the cis-regulatory sequence elements (cis- elements) in the promoters of two COX genes: human COX5B (for a ubiquitous subunit VB), and bovine COX8H (for subunit VIII-heart). They will: (1) identify by DNA sequencing those cis-elements in the promoter of the COX5B gene known to be important for transcriptional control of other genes; (2) identify unique cis- elements important for transcriptional control of respiratory genes by functional analysis of the COX5B promoter through a) analysis of DNAseI hypersensitive sites, b) gene fusion experiments, and C) transient expression studies; (3) clone and sequence the promoter of the bovine COX8H gene to identify unique cis-elements important for tissue-specific expression. These studies on the cis- regulatory sequence elements controlling expression of nuclear genes for this unique enzyme complex will contribute to our understanding of the genetic regulatory signals involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and in tissue=specific expression of this important enzyme complex.*** //\n",

This project will use oxygen isotopic techniques to document the spatial and temporal distribution of fluids in a well constrained structural sections by using oxygen isotopes as tracers.

      "a9005589 MCB $279879 The dramatic cell differentiation undergone by Naegleria gruberi, from amoebae to flagellates, is unique as a model system in the rapidity, synchrony, reproducibility, homogeneity, and Accessibility of a major phenotypic change. Differentiation-specific molecules synthesized during this change include two calmodulins, one that becomes localized in the flagella and the other that remains in the cell body. Cloning and sequencing of the single flagellar calmodulin gene revealed provocative structural features that may be implicated in regulation of its programmed transcription, in the stability of its mRNA, and in the localization of its protein. In order to test these possibilities, and to make this system advantageous for other studies, this laboratory is working vigorously to obtain DNA-mediated transformation of Naegleria. In addition, initial searches for DNA clones to cell body calmodulin have led to the discovery of two additional calcium-binding protein genes expressed during differentiation. One encodes a calcineurin B-like protein; the other and undefined calcium-binding protein whose gene sequence is related to flagellar calmodulin DNA but which is expressed earlier in differentiation. The goals of this research are to find the calmodulin-2 gene and to dissect these multiple calmodulin-like proteins in Naegleria, while continuing to seek DNA-mediated transformation in this remarkable organism. The unicellular eukaryote, Naegleria gruberi reproduces as amoebae. If conditions are suitable, the amoebae undergo a rapid, dramatic differentiation into lively, swimming flagellates with a fixed, streamlined body contour. The flagellates are temporary, do not reproduce, and eventually revert back to amoebae. The long-term goal of this research is to elucidate the sequence of events (from environmental trigger, through programmed changes in gene expression, to localization of differentiation-specific gene products) that underlie these differentiation events. The current goals of this project are to identify and characterize genes for proteins involved in the regulation of cellular functions by calcium. Since the genes for these regulatory molecules are expressed differently at different stages of the differentiation process in different parts of the organism, it is likely that they represent an important link in this chain of events.\n",
      "a9005590 MCB $272555 Xyloglucans are plant cell wall matrix polysaccharides that are synthesized by enzymes in the membranes of the Golgi apparatus. Xyloglucan plays a central role in both cell wall structure and function. In addition, it may have a regulatory function in the process of controlling plant growth and development. It is a complex polysaccharide, yet compared to some it is relatively simple. This proposal describes a program of research designed to clarify the activities of xyloglucan synthase enzymes and the products they make. The overall objective of this project is to refine the xyloglucan biosynthesis system for use as a model for the study of both plant cell wall polysaccharide biosynthesis and the structure and functional organization of the plant Golgi apparatus. These two research topics are closely related and completion of this research will significantly increase our understanding of both. Golgi membranes isolated from suspension- cultured Acer pseudoplatanus (sycamore maple) cells are being subfractionated and these partially purified membrane fractions are being used as a source of xyloglucan synthases. Combinations of glycosyl composition analysis, methylation linkage analysis, and radiogas proportional counting are being used to determine identities of incorporated radiolabeled residues and the linkages between them. The glycosyl transferases involved with xyloglucan synthesis is being purified so that eventual subcellular localization and compartment mapping of plant Golgi are possible. Successful completion of this study will result in a greater understanding of the process of plant cell wall synthesis as well as the structure and function of the plant apparatus. There are many unanswered fundamental questions in plant biology. What influence cell wall biogenesis has on plant growth and development is one such question. This research offers an opportunity for progress in this area. Xyloglucans are an important component of plant cell walls both structurally and functionally. They allow the cell wall to maintain a degree of flexibility and are implicated in auxin-stimulated elongation during growth. This research is an in-depth study of the biosynthesis of these important cell wall sugars and provides a better understanding of the Golgi apparatus which produces the enzymes responsible for their synthesis.\n",

      "a9005602 MCB $278000 The experiments proposed here ask what role mRNA processing plays in regulating the structure, stability and translation of messenger RNAs. Specifically, we intend to identify both the cellular factors involved in mRNA 3' end cleavage and polyadenylation and the genes that encode them. We will then be able to ask physiological and biochemical questions about the roles of these factors in the regulation of mRNA levels during cellular growth and at different stages of the cell cycle. We will employ a direct biochemical assay to screen a large collection of conditional lethal mutants for enzymatic defects in mRNA 3' end formation that affect cell viability or growth. We will clone and characterize the genes using classical genetic and molecular biological techniques. We will search for second site revertants in the expectation of identifying other genes whose products play a role in mRNA processing. These mutants will also be used in temperature shift studies to determine the effects of each defect on the stability, nucleocytoplasmic transport and translation of mRNAs. The isolated genes will be used to determine the effect of knockout mutations, site directed alterations and controlled expression on cell growth and the ultimate fate of the abnormally processed mRNAs. In a parallel biochemical approach, we will begin to purify the factors which catalyze specific cleavage and polyadenylation of yeast mRNAs. This is a proposal to investigate a very poorly understood part of the process by which genetic information is decoded and expressed, viz. the assembly of a finished messenger RNA molecule from its precursor, and the transport of the messenger RNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.\n",

This volume was especially important because of the discovery and publication of the correspondence between the young Einstein and his fellow student and first wife, Mileva Maric. Volume two, begun under Dr. Stachel, was published in 1990 under the editorship of Dr. Martin Klein. This volume included Einstein's publications from 1901 to 1909, among them a number of works that were absolutely crucial in the development of 20th century science. Both volumes were accompanied by an English translation produced under the direction of Dr. Peter Havas. With this three year grant, Dr. Martin Klein, with Drs. Jurgen Renn and Robert Schulmann, will complete the preparation of volumes 3 through 7 of the Collected Papers. Volumes 3, 4, 6 & 7 will present Einstein's writings from 1910 to 1922. These papers include Einstein's work on his General Theory of Relativity. Volume 5 will present Einstein's correspondence from 1902 to 1914. This grant will also support the preparation of the accompanying English translation of these volumes. Dr. Klein is assuming responsibility for the translation as well as the edition. At the end of the three year period, it is the hope of the Princeton University Press to have raised an endowment to complete the publication of 29 volumes of Einstein papers. This project will continue well into the second decade of the next century. In the meantime, researchers will be actively working on these papers. NSF is pursuing additional ways of expediting this research.\n",

      "a9005606 IBN $285000 Polysphondylium pallidum is a cellular slime mold that forms distinctive spatial patterns during its like cycle. One of these patterns, the radial arrangement of spore-bearing arms about a central stalk, arises from a spheroidal mass of cells at the base of the developing organism. The emergence of the radial patterning from a spheroidal one is a true symmetry breaking event which Dr. Cox proposes to study in cellular and molecular detail by examining the structure and function of the genes involved. The genes coding for patterning elements will be studied by conventional cloning techniques and used to guess at possible functions; to study the timing and regulation of their transcripts; and to use them in antisense constructs and gene disruption experiments to ask whether or not the gene products are essential for development and morphogenesis. The long range goal of this research is a complete cellular understanding of morphogenesis in this simple system, with a view to relating the various contributions made by cell-cell signaling and physical interaction, the roles played by diffusible chemical signals, and the possible contribution to the process of forces such as cell movement, surface tension, and tissue deformation.\n",
      "a9005614 MCB $286000 One of the characteristic properties of tubulin, a 100 kdal protein comprising the central core of microtubules, is its ability to bind colchicine, an alkaloid isolated from the Autumn crocus. Colchicine binding to tubulin results in substoichiometric inhibition of tubulin polymerization and subsequent disruption of microtubule-mediated processes. The ubiquity and specificity of colchicine binding activity in higher eukaryotes implicates the colchicine binding site as having a possible role in the in vivo regulation of microtubule assembly. In order to confirm or deny the validity of this proposition, the interactions between tubulin and ligands binding to the colchicine site must first be understood. The location and sequence of the colchicine site on tubulin will be found using several novel photoaffinity labeling derivatives of colchicine in which the photolabile groups are situated very close to the interior of the binding site. This approach is innovative in that it is designed to identify peptides in the individual subdomains of the binding site. The unique spectroscopic properties of colchicine bound to tubulin have led the PI to propose that ligands bound to tubulin are engaged in a pi-stacking interaction with a tryptophan in the binding site. Associations of this type are known to occur between single-stranded DNA binding proteins and nucleic acids but have not yet been observed between a small molecule and a protein. Dr. Hastie will use the method of optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) to directly examine the effect of ligand binding on tubulin tryptophan(s). By employing heavy atom derivatives of the ligands, she intends to determine which aromatic ring of the ligand is stacking with the tryptophan. Kinetic and equilibrium parameters of selected ligands binding to tubulin will be determined in order to test a unified mechanism that explains how ligands which are structurally diverse bind to the protein at a single site. This information coupled with the photoaffinity labeling and ODMR results, will be used to construct a low resolution map of the receptor site.\n",

The four projects will make extensive use of NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography. Multinuclear variable temperature one- and two-dimensional NMR experiments will allow analysis of exchange, structure and conformations of organic and organometallic compounds. In addition, the structure of the organometallic complexes synthesized will be determined by X-ray crystallography. The projects will provide minority students with experience in using both methods of assigning structure and conformation and in the study of chemical and magnetization exchange.//\n",
      "a9005621 HRD $207750 Computer models provide a new arena of computer based scientific experimentation currently referred to as computational science. One subcomponent of this new science which we seek to advance is that of computational epidemiology. Based on existing strength in information management and computer modelling and expert systems as the vital subcomponents of computational epidemiology. Some problem-solving methods are quantitative and complex, and require computer modelling methods. Others are qualitative and fall in the domain of expert systems research. The task is to meld expert knowledge with computer modelling methods to advance epidemiologic knowledge management. Two approaches, one based on expert systems, and a second based on computer modelling will be utilized. Since the two methods appear to be different, they have generally been used separately. However, if the two are coupled, a more effective problem-solving and decision-support model may result. To test this core hypothesis, we will proceed to develop prototypes of the two systems and experiment with optimal coupling approaches using the bioepidemiologic dynamics of trypanosoma as the test bed. An outreach component will be embedded in the research environment so as to increase the number of minorities pursuing advanced studies in computational epidemiology. The research and outreach in tandem will lead to the development of resources that will form the backbone for long term research in computational epidemiology.\n",

      "a9005633 CCR $233921 The state of the art in parallel programming is characterized by a wide variety of process models, communication mechanisms, and patterns of sharing and protection. Experience suggests that no single model of parallelism will suffice in every case. Unfortunately, traditional operating systems tend to enforce a single model by embedding it in the kernel. Overcoming this limitation is the principal goal of the Psyche operating system. It is expected that Psyche will allow each programmer to use the most appropriate model for the task at hand, and will open up previously unavailable opportunities to use multiple models within a single application. This research focuses on Psyche as a testbed for multi-model parallel computing -- evaluating the extent to which the Psyche user interface makes multi-model programming possible, and determining the sorts of user-level tools, techniques, and conventions that are required to make it practical. Building on an existing multiprocessor implementation of Psyche, progressively more complicated user-level programs, beginning with coexisting but independent models of parallelism and working up to system servers that can interact with many kinds of clients, and applications that use more than one model of parallelism internally will be used in experiments. In the later phases of this work, expertise in our department's computer vision, robotics, and planning groups will be drawn on for the construction of large, multi-model reactive applications.\n",
      "a9005643 MCB $98000 The goals of this research are to define the sequence and structural elements of transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA) required for its recognition by proteins. Of particular interest is the recognition of E. coli tRNA for amino acid valine (tRNAVa1) by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and by the tRNA modifying enzyme, tRNA (uracil-5-)methyltransferase. Detailed understanding of these interactions will clarify questions concerning the fidelity of protein synthesis, the mechanisms of tRNA modification, and the role of modified nucleosides in tRNA function. The elements of tRNAVa1 essential for its recognition by valyl-tRNA synthetase (VRS) will be determined by examining the kinetics of reaction of tRNAVa1 variants. Minimal requirements for synthetase recognition will be explored with tRNA fragments containing the essential recog- nition elements of tRNAVa1. The structure of these mutant tRNAs will be probed by 19F NMR spectroscopy of tRNAVa1 labe- led with fluorine. Fluorinated tRNAVa1 is ideally suited for such studies because it remains fully functional and contains highly sensitive 19F probes distributed throughout all the helical stems and the loops of the tRNA molecule where they can serve to monitor local structural changes.\n",
      "a9005645 ATM $202231 The overall goal of this research project is to clarify our understanding of how cyclones (storms) and related atmospheric weather systems form and intensify. The results are likely to contribute to improved skill in weather prediction. Three phenomena will be investigated. The first are extratropical cyclones, particularly cases where there is rapid intensification. The PI hopes to identify the factors which cause cyclogenesis to be explosive. A second area of study is directed at mesoscale solitary gravity waves. These waves represent disturbances with the cyclone that typically are 100 kilometers wide and one hour in duration and cause very rapid pressure falls and sometimes dangerous winds. The third area involves the study of polar lows which are small intense cyclones that develop primarily over the ocean in polar regions. For all three topics, the PI will employ both observational and model- generated data sets. The latter will be taken from simulations done with mesoscale model at the National Center for Atmospheric Research.\n",

The use of supercomputers, however, presents many problems - new methods and new approaches need to be developed. The long-range goal of this project is to develop parallel algorithms for atomic structure calculations, based on the proven multiconfiguration Hartree-Fock method (MCHF), that execute efficiently on vector/concurrent architectures such as the shared memory Cray Y-MP and the distributed memory Intel iPSC-RX hypercube. The first task is the revision of the finite difference methods used by MCHF to spline based methods for which higher accuracy and better vectorization properties have been achieved. The use of splines in MCHF atomic structure calculations, leads to large, sparse, generalized eigenvalue problems for which only a few eigenvalues and eigenvectors are needed. Often the problem is a non-linear, generalized eigenvalue problem. Another frequently occurring problem is the solution of large, sparse, structured systems of equations where parts of the matrix are dense. Vector/concurrent algorithms for these problems will be developed and incorporated into an atomic structure package based on the MCHF method.\n",

      "a9005698 DMS $22000 This is a grant under the Scientific Computing Research Equipment for the Mathematical Sciences program of the Division of Mathematical Sciences of the National Sciences Foundation. This program supports the purchase of special purpose computing equipment dedicated to the conduct of research in the mathematical sciences. This equipment is required for several research projects and would be difficult to justify for one project alone. Support from the National Science Foundation is coupled with discounts and contributions from manufacturers and with substantial cost-sharing from the institutions submitting the proposal. This program is an example of academic, corporate, and government cooperation in the support of the basic research in the mathematical sciences. This equipment will be used to support five research projects in the Department of Mathematics of Brandeis University: Green's conjecture on the free resolution of canonical curves, the investigator is David Eisenbud; equivariant free resolutions and equivariant Groebner bases, the investigators are David Buchsbaum and Eisenbud; development of \"Macaulay\", the investigator is Eisenbud; hypergeometric series identities and generalized symmetric functions, the investigator is Ira Gessel; completely integrable systems, the investigators are Mark Adler and Pierre Van Moerbeke.\n",
      "a9005700 ATM $143200 The PI will conduct airborne measurements of 222Rn as part of the Pacific Stratus/Sulfur Investigation. The radionuclide measurements will compliment measurements made by the NASA/Ames tracking sun photometer, the NOAA/PMEL sulfur gas chromatograph and the NOAA aerosol size distribution probes to investigate the postulated link between marine dimethyl sulfide emissions and the reflective properties of marine stratus clouds. Altitude profiles will be conducted to locate layers of enhanced particle abundance or thin cloud, and samples for radionuclide and sulfur gas analysis will be collected in and between the layers. Source origins and degree of recent aerosol scavenging and free troposphere - boundary layer exchange will be assessed in conjunction with measurements made on other PSI platforms, meteorological analyses, and satellite observations.\n",
      "a9005702 DEB $160000 Rats and mice of the South American murid rodent radiation (the largely endemic subfamily Sigmodontinae) represent a very large array of organisms that range in morphologic adaptations from subfossorial to aquatic to arborel and in habitat from tropical rainforest of the Amazon Basin to puna grassland in the highest elevations of the Andes. This adaptive radiation comprises some 70 genera, most of which are commonly divided into one of five major lineages. Among these, the akodontines are among the most diverse and oldest, with fossils of modern forms extending back some 6 million years in Argentina. Despite the widely recognized diversification of this lineage, most taxa are both poorly known and defined, and phylogenetic, ecologic, and life history aspects of their biology are either totally unknown or only barely so. This is particularly true for the akodontine group, a radiation of some 15 genera and about 50 species largely confined to grassland habitats from the northern Andes to the Patagonian steppes. The present research will utilize DNA sequences, obtained from several genes within the mithochrondrial genome by the technique of the Polymerase Chain Reaction, to address the following set of general goals: (1) establish an hypothesis of phylogenetic relationships among all genera and most species of the complex; (2) perform a text of the model of species formation resulting from divergence across strong habitat gradients, using selected species inhabiting the steep eastern slope of the Andes as exemplars; and (3) determine whether or not particular cranial conformations that identify highly derived taxa within this assemblage share a close common ancestor or whether this type of cranial structure has evolved repeatedly in separate lineages. The exciting aspect of this research is that, since DNA can be extracted and amplified from dried skin specimens already preserved within natural history collections, now extinct or exceedingly rare taxa can be compared in ways never before available. Five of the genera of concern, for example, are each known form very few specimens, most of which only collected once from very remote areas. This is, therefore, the first study of relationships within the group to examine all extant taxa in a comparative way.\n",
      "a9005709 EAR $375000 This award provides support for the operation of the ion microprobe regional facility in the Department of Geology and Geophysics at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI). The facility provides analytical support for a large number of projects in the geosciences that require microanalysis of trace element and isotope abundances with excellent spatial resolution down to 10 microns. The facility is accessible to the national community of geoscientists outside WHOI for a minimum of 50% of its operating time.\n",
      "a9005717 EAR $147500 A Comprehensive program of research is planned that is centered on the oxygen isotope analyses of phosphate from both natural materials and various forms of apatite that will be synthesized in the laboratory. Specific goals are (1) the refinement of the method of preparation and isotopic analysis of phosphatic oxygen, (2) the experimental determination of the equilibrium oxygen isotope fractionation factors between dissolved phosphate and water and between various crystalline apatites and water over a very large range of temperatures from near Oo to 8OOoC, (3) the development of a single mineral oxygen isotope thermometer based on hydroxapatite and application to natural systems, (5) the use of 18O contents of teeth and bones to make important distinctions between marine and fresh water fish. Some novel techniques will be employed in conducting this research. The extraction of oxygen from very small samples of phosphate will be made with a laser fluorination system recently established at the University of Michigan. Catalysts will be used to obtain exchange equilibrium between phosphates and water at relatively low temperatures. Well crystallized hydroxy-and fluorapatite will be synthesized by a bacterial reaction in which enzymatic activity should promote attainment of isotopic exchange equilibrium. Obtaining reliable equilibrium fractionation factors in these systems over a large temperature range will be extremely useful in the resolution of a variety of petrological, paleoclimatological and paleoecological problems.\n",
      "a9005720 EAR $25000 The nature of the mechanical behavior of high-grade, isotropic basement rocks that allow them to accommodate the fold shapes of sedimentary cover sequences is a problem common to many orogens. This renewal will continue research on several examples of such folds in the Rocky Mountain foreland. This work will synthesize existing data on the fold geometry and detailed kinematic information of these examples. Results are expected to be applicable to a number of orogens containing basement-cored folds.\n",
      "a9005722 MCB $85000 The proposed research will integrate biophysical, biochemical, cellular, physiological and genetic studies on plasmodesmata (pd) to establish an appropriate framework that will then allow an investigation of the cellular processes by which the plant regulates its cell-to-cell communication system. Biophysical studies will be performed on a simple cellular system in order to determine the unitary pd conductance. Such measurements are essential for a further sub-structural analysis of the pd, as well as to provide a rigorous foundation for detailed studies on the cellular controls that orchestrate cell-to-cell size exclusion limits. Physiological studies on the role of pd in solute fluxes will also be performed. Since pd are likely to be an important determinant of organ development, an experimental system will be established that will permit identification of the processes that control secondary pd formation. In this ongoing collaboration (between Beachy and Dr. William Lucas of the University of California, Davis), it has been established that transgenic tobacco plants in which the 30 kDa movement protein (MP) of TMV is expressed have pd whose size exclusion limits are up-regulated to sizes in excess of 9.4 kDa. The mode by which the 30 kDa TMV-MP effects this change will be further explored. It is hypothesized that this protein interacts directly with the plasmodesma. Based on this concept, biochemical isolation and purification of pd proteins are proposed. A genetic system in Arabidopsis will be developed to permit the identification and isolation of genes involved in virus movement and pd function. Plasmodesmata are microscopic channels between individual plant cells. Intercellular communication by passage of molecules through these channels is critical for the normal development and physiological function of the entire plant. In certain plant viral infections, the virus gains access to the cell interior at a localized site and passes from cell to cell through the plasmodesmata throughout the plant. Passage of the virus through plasmodesmata is facilitated by a virally encoded protein which effectively enlarges the plasmodesmatal channel. This research will take advantage of the viral protein to identify and study the components of the plant plasmodesmata. Knowledge of the components of plasmodesmata will facilitate further studies of the formation of plasmodesmata and the mechanisms by which molecular traffic through the plasmodesmata is regulated. The results of this research will be important contributions to basic knowledge of cell to cell communication in plants.\n",
      "a9005725 EAR $70000 This collaborative research between Cornell University and Memphis State University is to process data previously collected under NSF-supported PANDA network deployment in the San Juan and Jujuy provinces of Argentina. Over 20,000 earthquakes in San Juan, and over 1000 earthquakes in Jujuy were recorded, producing over 100 GBytes of digital seismic data. The objective of the project is to study crustal and lithospheric structure and seismicity in two contrasting areas of the eastern slopes of the Andean uplift where seismogenic crustal shortening is occurring.\n",
      "a9005727 CHE $255025 With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program will support the research of Dr. Gary A. Molander of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Colorado. Dr. Molander's research focuses on the area of stereoselective synthesis. Methodology involving neighboring group participation, the use of optically active organometallics and utilization of chiral epoxides form the basis of the proposed studies. Dr. Molander will center his efforts on three areas of stereoselective organic synthesis. First, Dr. Molander will strive to develop a general method for achieving 1,4- and 1,5-relative asymmetric induction in the addition of carbon nucleophiles to prochiral electrophilic centers. In a second area, he will generate chiral organometallics using thermodynamic equilibration of an internally complexed organomagnesium. In a third, he will probe unique uses of enantiomerically enriched oxiranes in organic synthesis. Several methods for regio- and stereocontrolled ring opening reactions of oxiranes are proposed, all of which constitute useful routs to enantiomerically enriched organic molecules.\n",
      "a9005729 DMS $133339 Professors Harrell and Loss will conduct research on spectral and variational analysis in several areas originating in theoretical physics. Three of their projects involve (i) direct and inverse spectral questions about Schroedinger and Laplace- Beltrami operators, (ii) proofs of inequalities using the method of competing symmetries, and (iii) continuous spectra and their gaps. The research program is a balance between pure and applied mathematics with a twofold purpose. First, Harrell and Loss wish to create formulae and theorems of real use to physicists, especially those working in quantum theory and statistical physics. Secondly, the investigation may only be distantly related to physical calculation, but can cast light on structural questions, such as what role symmetries and geometry play in the spectral and inverse spectral theory of Schroedinger operators and their generalizations.\n",
      "a9005734 MCB $267000 The long term objectives of this research are to understand hydrogen metabolism during the anaerobic growth of bacteria in terms of the enzymatic mechanisms of H2 activation, the catalytic roles of nickel and non-heme iron, the number and structure of hydrogenases, the mechanisms of their cellular localizations, the insertion of metal redox centers and the roles of hydrogenases in the bioenergetics of anaerobic bacteria. Hydrogenase and H2 are of general biological and biotechnological importance as they are intimately involved in dinitrogen fixation, the photoproduction of H2 from water, complex microbial fermentations useful for the production of fuels and chemicals, and as normal flora of the intestinal tracts of higher animals. The specific aims of the proposed research are: to obtain an x-ray crystallographic structure of the nickel- containing hydrogenases; to define the structure of the nickel- containing active site and the three iron non-heme iron clusters; to further refine the activation and catalytic cycles involved in H2 utilization; to develope a DNA transfer system for the sulfate reducing bacteria; to use this system for the biosynthesis of active hydrogenases with recombinant DNA; to prepare modified hydrogenases by site-directed mutagenesis and study from the sulfate reducing bacteria their biochemical properties; and to establish the roles of multiple hydrogenases in selected anaerobic microorganisms.\n",
      "a9005736 INT $32961 The primary objective of this U.S.-Poland research project between Dr. Richard Hetnarski of the Rochester Institute of Technology and Dr. Jozef Ignaczak of the Polish Institute of Fundamental Technology Research is to analyze wave propagation in generalized thermoelastic solids. The researchers hope to gain a better understanding of interactions between the mechanical and thermal fields in a continuum. Efforts will emphasize fundamental work pertaining to temperature-rate dependent thermoelasticity (TRDT) theory and nonlinear dynamic coupled thermoelasticity (NDCT) theory. Results are expected to contribute to our basic knowledge of the principles underlying high-temperature superconductivity and semiconductor processing. This engineering project in solid mechanics fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine compelmentary talents and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.\n",
